/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ005-0062-001.wav|in some respects these plans are defective
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ005-0062-002.wav|especially in the placing of the governor's residence in the centre of the

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ008-0127-000.wav|as we were crossing the press yard
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ008-0128-000.wav|the dreadful execrations of some of the felons so shook his frame
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ008-0128-001.wav|that he observed the clock had struck
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ008-0128-002.wav|and quickening his pace
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ008-0129-000.wav|he soon arrived at the room where the sheriff was to give a receipt for his body

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ008-0130-000.wav|before the colonel had been pinioned
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ008-0130-001.wav|he had pulled out two white handkerchiefs

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ008-0132-001.wav|he placed a white cap

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ008-0133-000.wav|he was dressed in a mixed colored loose coat

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ008-0134-001.wav|he ascended the stairs at the debtor's door
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ008-0135-000.wav|and stepped out
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ008-0135-001.wav|on to the platform to be received
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ008-0135-002.wav|as has been said
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ008-0135-003.wav|by prolonged yells
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ008-0136-000.wav|these evidently deprived him of the small portion of fortitude he had summoned up

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ008-0137-001.wav|under extreme pressure of ignominy
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ008-0138-000.wav|and at his request
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ008-0138-001.wav|the ordinary drew the cap further down over his face
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ008-0138-002.wav|when in an instant
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ008-0139-000.wav|without waiting for any signal

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ008-0139-002.wav|and he was launched into eternity
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ008-0140-000.wav|whenever the public attention had been specially called to a particular crime
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ008-0140-001.wav|either on account of its atrocity

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ008-0264-001.wav|of the total number sentenced to death and for the rest there was a long period of anxious suspense

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ008-0270-000.wav|and while the courts adhered to the letter of the law appeals were constantly made to the royal prerogative of mercy

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0127-001.wav|part in it
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0128-000.wav|i have been present at the scene not less than twenty times

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0129-000.wav|that many of the kneeling men or boys laughed while they knelt

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0129-002.wav|and when they could do so without fear of being seen by any officer of the prison

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0131-001.wav|to make the ordinary believe they had been crying

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0214-001.wav|an immense concourse of persons
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0214-002.wav|eager to get a sight of the murderer's remains

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0215-002.wav|were crowded with spectators

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0216-001.wav|which had served for the execution
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0217-000.wav|or on another specially erected on some commanding spot
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0217-001.wav|had fallen into disuse by eighteen thirty
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0218-000.wav|but there was an attempt to revive it at that date
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0218-001.wav|when the act for dispensing with the dissection of criminals was past
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0219-000.wav|a clause was inserted to the effect that

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0220-001.wav|should either be hung in chains
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0220-002.wav|or buried under the gallows on which they had been executed

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0222-000.wav|the revival of this barbarous practice
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0222-001.wav|caused much indignation in certain

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0223-000.wav|but it was actually tried in two provincial towns
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0223-001.wav|leicester and durham
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0224-000.wav|at the first named
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0224-001.wav|the exhibition nearly created a tumult
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0224-002.wav|and the body was taken down and buried
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0225-000.wav|but not before the greatest scandal had been caused by the unseemly proceedings of the crowd
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0225-001.wav|that flocked to see the sight
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0225-002.wav|a sort of fair was held
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0226-000.wav|gaming tables were set up
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0226-001.wav|cards were played under the gibbet
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0226-002.wav|to the disturbance of the public peace
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0226-003.wav|and the annoyance of all decent people
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0227-000.wav|at garostake
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0227-001.wav|where the dura murderer's body was exposed
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0227-002.wav|theye were similar scenes
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0227-003.wav|mingled with compassion for the culprit's family
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0228-000.wav|and a subscription was set on foot for them
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0228-001.wav|den and there
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0228-002.wav|at the foot of the gibbet
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0229-000.wav|later on after dark

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0229-002.wav|and buried it in the sand
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0229-003.wav|and this was the end of hanging in chains
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0230-000.wav|after this a law was passed which prescribed that the bodies of all executed murderers should be buried within the walls of the jail

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0232-001.wav|owing to the bungling and unskilful way
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0232-002.wav|in which the operation was performed

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0233-001.wav|although it was not often that the horrid scene seen at jersey
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0233-002.wav|at the beginning of the century was repeated
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0234-001.wav|the hangman added his weight
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0234-002.wav|to that of the suspended culprit
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0235-000.wav|and having first pulled him sideways then got upon his shoulders
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0235-001.wav|so that the rope
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0236-000.wav|to the great surprise of all who witnessed
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0236-001.wav|this dreadful scene
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0237-000.wav|the poor criminal rose straight upon his feet
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0237-001.wav|with a hangman on his shoulders and immediately loosened the rope with his fingers
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0238-000.wav|after this
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0238-001.wav|the sheriffs sent for another rope
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0238-002.wav|but the spectators interfered
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0238-003.wav|and the man was carried back to jail
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0239-000.wav|the whole case was referred to the king
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0239-001.wav|and the poor wretch
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0239-002.wav|whose crime had been a military one
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0239-003.wav|was eventually pardoned

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0241-001.wav|and were again brought out in the afternoon
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0241-002.wav|by which time fresh and stronger ropes had been procured
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0242-000.wav|and the sentence was properly and completely carried out

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0245-000.wav|he soon rose to his feet
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0245-001.wav|and hearing the sorrowful exclamations of the populace

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0247-002.wav|although there was no failure of apparatus
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0248-000.wav|sometimes the condemned man made a hard fight for life

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0251-001.wav|and continued to struggle with the officials for some time
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0251-003.wav|eventually he was pinioned with a cord in the usual manner
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0252-000.wav|on the scaffold
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0252-001.wav|he made a violent attempt to loosen his bonds
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0252-002.wav|and succeeded in getting his hands free

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0255-001.wav|was struggling with the most determined violence
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0255-002.wav|to the great horror of the spectators

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0257-000.wav|and having got from the falling drop
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ009-0257-001.wav|to the firm part of the platform

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ011-0137-000.wav|the attorney general introduced a bill to abolish capital punishment entirely for forgery

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ011-0148-001.wav|and which was of a distinctly fraudulent nature

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ011-0171-000.wav|was the state of her father's affairs

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ011-0173-001.wav|and they travelled night and day towards the north
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ011-0174-000.wav|but a candle
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ011-0174-001.wav|there was no mister turner

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ011-0179-000.wav|so that it might become the exclusive property of her husband whoever he might be

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ011-0181-001.wav|and declared that unless the marriage came off
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ011-0181-002.wav|mister turner must be sold up

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ013-0190-000.wav|and at last

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ013-0192-001.wav|and a liberal subscription was raised among the foreign servants in london
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ013-0192-002.wav|to provide funds for his defence

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ013-0194-000.wav|but on the second day the discovery of fresh evidence

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ013-0195-001.wav|to make a full confession of his crime
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ013-0195-002.wav|to the lawyers who defended him

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ013-0202-001.wav|gave way to hopeless dejection
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ013-0203-000.wav|on his removal to newgate after sentence
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ013-0204-000.wav|he admitted that he had been justly convict
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ013-0204-001.wav|and expressed great anxiety that his fellow servants should be relieved from all suspicion

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ013-0206-000.wav|next morning he made a full confession

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ013-0207-001.wav|he gave as the motives of his crime a quarrel he had with his master

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0059-001.wav|which were discovered almost simultaneously

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0064-001.wav|by the slackness of system

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0074-003.wav|through his activity

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0077-000.wav|he was not the first man of loose morality
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0077-001.wav|and expensive tastes
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0078-000.wav|who preferred to risk his future reputation and liberty

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0078-002.wav|of living upon narrow means
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0079-000.wav|the temptation was all the greater
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0079-001.wav|because the chances of successful fraud
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0079-002.wav|lay ready to hand

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0081-000.wav|he conceived the idea of transferring shares

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0082-000.wav|he took it for granted that the certificates representing these bogus shares
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0082-001.wav|and which practically did not exist
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0082-002.wav|would never be called for
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0083-000.wav|this ingenious method of raising funds
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0083-001.wav|he adopted
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0083-002.wav|and carried on without detection
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0084-000.wav|till the defalcations from fraudulent transfers and fraudulent

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0084-002.wav|combined amounted
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0084-003.wav|to twenty seven thousand pounds

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0087-000.wav|entertained literary artistic and dramatic celebrities
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0087-001.wav|had a smart turn out
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0087-002.wav|tended all the race meetings and dressed in the latest fashion
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0088-000.wav|to his wife poor soul he made no pretense of fidelity
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0088-001.wav|and she enjoyed only so much of his company as was necessarily spent
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0089-000.wav|in receiving guests at home
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0089-001.wav|or could be spared from two rival establishments in other parts of the town
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0090-000.wav|to account for his revenues
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0090-001.wav|he pretended to have been very lucky on the stock exchange
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0090-002.wav|which was
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0090-003.wav|at one time true to a limited extent
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0091-000.wav|and to have succeeded in other speculations
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0092-000.wav|when his friends asked for a he
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0092-001.wav|a wealthy man of independent means
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0092-002.wav|continued to slave on as a clerk
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0092-003.wav|on a pittance
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0093-000.wav|he replied gaily that his regular work at the crystal palace office
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0093-001.wav|was useful as a sort of discipline and kept him steady
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0094-000.wav|all this time
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0094-001.wav|his position was one of extreme insecurity
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0094-002.wav|he was standing over a mine
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0094-003.wav|which at any moment might explode
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0095-000.wav|the blow fell suddenly
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0095-001.wav|and when least expected
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0095-002.wav|one morning mister fasson asked casually for certain certificates
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0096-000.wav|whether representing real or fictitious shares does not appear
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0096-001.wav|but they were certificates connected in some way with robson's long practised frauds
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0097-000.wav|and he could not produce them
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0097-001.wav|his chief asked sternly where they were
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0098-000.wav|robson said they were at kilburn priory
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0099-000.wav|let us go to kilburn for them together said mister phasson growing suspicious
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0100-000.wav|they drove there
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0100-001.wav|and robson on arrival
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0100-002.wav|did the honors of his house
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0100-003.wav|rang for lunch to gain time
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0101-000.wav|but at mister fasson's pressing demands went upstairs to fetch the certificates
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0102-000.wav|he came back to explain that he had mislaid them

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0103-001.wav|would not accept this subterfuge
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0103-002.wav|and declared they must be found
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0104-000.wav|robson again left him
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0104-001.wav|but only to gather together hastily
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0104-002.wav|all the money and valuables on which he could lay his hands
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0104-003.wav|with which he left the house
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0105-000.wav|mister fasson waited and waited for his subordinate to reappear
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0105-001.wav|and at last
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0105-002.wav|discovered his flight
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0106-000.wav|and lennard
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0106-001.wav|was forthwith offered for robson's apprehension
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0107-000.wav|meanwhile
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0107-001.wav|the absconding clerk had coolly driven to a favorite dining place in the west end
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0108-000.wav|where a fish curry
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0108-001.wav|and a brace of partridges were set before him
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0109-000.wav|and he discussed the latter with appetite
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0109-001.wav|but begged
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0109-002.wav|that they would never give him curry again

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0036-000.wav|about fifty feet from the ground level and above the cistern
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0036-001.wav|a revolving cheveau de free of
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0036-002.wav|iron was fixed
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0037-000.wav|with only a short interval between it and the wall
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0037-001.wav|supported by a horizontal iron railing with upright point
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0038-000.wav|in the wall above the chabeau de frize
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0038-001.wav|projected a series of iron spikes sharp enough to forbid further ascent
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0039-000.wav|williams surveyed these formidable obstacles to evasion
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0039-001.wav|and calmly proceeded to surmount them
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0040-000.wav|his first task
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0040-001.wav|was to gain the top of the cistern
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0040-003.wav|he affected by keeping his back to one side of the angle
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0041-000.wav|and working with his hands behind him
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0041-001.wav|while he used his bare feet like claws upon the other side of the wall angle
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0042-000.wav|the condition of the stone surface just mentioned
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0042-001.wav|assisted him in this
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0042-002.wav|and he managed
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0042-003.wav|to get beyond the cistern
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0042-004.wav|to the railing below the shabeau de freze
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0043-000.wav|the least slip now would have been fatal to him
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0043-001.wav|but he could not thrust his body in through the narrow space left by the shivau de frece
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0044-000.wav|and was compelled to work along the railing
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0044-001.wav|round three quarters
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0044-002.wav|of the square of the yard
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0045-000.wav|and at length
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0045-001.wav|reached a point opposite the top of the
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0045-002.wav|building
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0045-003.wav|containing the condemned wards
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0045-004.wav|this had been a perilous and
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0045-005.wav|painful task
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0046-000.wav|the spikes of the railing penetrated his flesh and made progression slow and difficult
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0047-000.wav|but the worst part of the business was to jump from this irksome foothold of the iron grating
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0047-001.wav|on to the top of the building just mentioned
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0048-000.wav|a distance of eight or nine feet
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0049-000.wav|he had here completed his assent
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0050-000.wav|his next job was to descend outside newgate
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0051-000.wav|clambering along the roof
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0052-000.wav|he passed to the top of the ordinary's residence
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0052-001.wav|hoping to find an open skylight by which he might enter and so work
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0052-002.wav|downstairs
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0053-000.wav|if the worst came to the worst
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0053-001.wav|he intended to have gone down some chimney
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0053-002.wav|as he had often done before in the way of business
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0054-000.wav|but he did not like the risk of entering a room by the fireplace and the chances of detection it offered
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0055-000.wav|he traversed vainly all the roofs in newgate street
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0056-000.wav|running a great risk of discovery as he passed by a lot of workmen at tyler's manufactory in warwick square
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0056-001.wav|which had formerly been the college of physicians
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0057-000.wav|as his coat was an encumbrance
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0057-001.wav|he left it on the top of the third house in newgate street

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0058-000.wav|he worked along to the roofs in warwick lane

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0059-002.wav|on the leads hanging out clothes to dry
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0060-000.wav|williams concealed himself
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0060-001.wav|behind a chimney till she had re entered her garret
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0061-000.wav|and then
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0061-001.wav|following her down a step ladder into the house
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0061-002.wav|told his story
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0061-003.wav|pealed to and one her compassion
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0062-000.wav|she suffered him to pass downstairs
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0063-001.wav|he met another woman and a girl
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0063-002.wav|both of whom were terrified at his appearance but
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0064-000.wav|when he explained that he was running away from the gallows
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0064-001.wav|they left him the road clear
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0065-000.wav|to walk out into the street was an easy affair and he was now free

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0178-002.wav|on the strength of it
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0179-000.wav|contracted with sheriffs and conveners to work by the job

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0215-002.wav|which from time immemorial had been the hangman's wages

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0216-002.wav|and it may be doubted whether he was entitled to it
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0217-000.wav|on one particular occasion however he got them
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0217-001.wav|a gentleman whose since brought him to the gallows at maidstone
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0218-000.wav|wished to do cowlcraft a good turn
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0218-001.wav|and sent to his london tailor for a complete new suit

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0224-000.wav|cowcraft shared the odium which his office not strangely

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0224-002.wav|but he was admitted into the jail
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0225-000.wav|which his predecessors were not
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0225-002.wav|who werepaid their wages over the gate
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0225-003.wav|to obviate the necessity for letting them enter
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0226-000.wav|to this curious etiquette was due the appointment of an official whose office has long since disappeared the yeoman of the halter

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0227-002.wav|and who was paid a fee of five shillings

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0229-002.wav|referred to the officers of the jail

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0232-001.wav|which would follow him about like a dog
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0233-000.wav|in his own profession
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0234-000.wav|he was not unskilful
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0234-001.wav|but he proceeded entirely by rule of thumb
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0234-002.wav|leaving the result very much to chance and the strength of the rope
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0235-000.wav|he was so much in favor of short drops

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0306-001.wav|as part of the whole subject of capital punishment
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0306-002.wav|had been referred to a royal commission in january eighteen sixty four
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0307-000.wav|full evidence was taken on all points
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0307-001.wav|and on that regarding public executions
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0307-002.wav|there was a great preponderance of opinion towards their abolition
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0308-000.wav|yet the witnesses were not unanimous
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0309-000.wav|some of the judges would have retained the public spectacle
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0309-001.wav|the ordinary of newgate was not certain that public executions were not the best
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0310-000.wav|another distinguished witness feared
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0311-000.wav|that any secrecy in the treatment of the condemned
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0311-001.wav|would invest them with a new and greater interest
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0311-002.wav|which was much to be deprecated
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0312-000.wav|foreign witnesses too
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0312-001.wav|were in favor of publicity
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0313-000.wav|on the other hand
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0313-001.wav|lord cranworth and wensleydale recommended private executions
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0313-002.wav|so did mister spencer walpole m p
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0314-000.wav|sir george grey thought there was a growing feeling in favor of executions within the prison precincts
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0315-000.wav|colonel now sir edmund henderson
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0315-001.wav|was strongly in favor of them
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0316-000.wav|based on his experience of them
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0316-001.wav|in western australia he not only thought them likely to be more deterrant
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0317-000.wav|but believed that a public ceremony destroyed the whole value of an execution
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0318-000.wav|other officials great lawyers governors of
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0318-001.wav|prisons and chaplains supported this view
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0319-000.wav|the only doubts expressed were as to the sufficiency of the safeguards as to the certainty of death
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0319-001.wav|and its subsequent publication
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0320-000.wav|but these it was thought
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0320-001.wav|might be provided by the admission of the press and the holding of a coroner's inquest
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0321-000.wav|duly impressed with the weight of evidence in favor of abolition
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0322-000.wav|the commission recommended
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0322-001.wav|that death sentences should be carried out within the jail
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0322-002.wav|under such regulations as might be considered necessary
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0323-000.wav|to prevent abuse
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0323-001.wav|and satisfy the public
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0323-002.wav|that the law had been complied with
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0324-000.wav|but it is curious to note
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0324-001.wav|that there were several dissentions among the commissioners to this paragraph of the report
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0325-000.wav|the judge of the admiralty court

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0326-001.wav|mister william yewert and last but not least

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0327-000.wav|declared that they were not prepared
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0327-001.wav|to agree to the resolution respecting private executions
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0328-000.wav|nevertheless in the very next session
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0329-000.wav|a bill was introduced by mister hibbert
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0329-002.wav|and accepted by the government
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0329-003.wav|providing for the future carrying out of executions within prisons
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0330-000.wav|it was read for the first time in march eighteen sixty six
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0330-001.wav|but did not become law
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0330-002.wav|till eighteen sixty eight
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0331-000.wav|the last public execution in front of newgate was that of the fennian michael barrett
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0332-000.wav|who was convicted of complicity in the clerkenwell explosion intended to effect the release of burke and casey
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0333-000.wav|from clerkenwell prison by which many persons lost their lives
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0334-000.wav|unusual precautions were taken upon this occasion
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0334-001.wav|as some fresh outrage was apprehended
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0335-000.wav|there was no interference with the crowd
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0335-001.wav|which collected as usual although not to the customary extent
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0336-000.wav|but newgate and its neighborhood was carefully held by the police both city and metropolitan
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0337-000.wav|in the houses opposite the prison
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0337-001.wav|numbers of detectives mixed with the spectators
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0338-000.wav|inside the jail was colonel fraser the chief commissioner of the city police and at no great distance although in the background
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0339-000.wav|troops were held in readiness to act if required
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0339-001.wav|everything passed off quite quietly however
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0340-000.wav|and cowlcraft who had been threatened with summary retribution if he executed barrett carried out the sentence without mishap
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0341-000.wav|the sufferer was stolid and reticent to the last
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0342-000.wav|the first private execution under the new law
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0342-001.wav|took place within the precincts of maidstone jail
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0343-000.wav|the sufferer was a porter on the london

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0343-002.wav|sentenced to death for shooting the station master at dover
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0344-000.wav|the ceremony which was witnessed by only a few officials and representatives of the press was performed with the utmost decency and decorum
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0346-000.wav|a fact duly advertised as completed by the hoisting of the black flag over the jail
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0347-000.wav|had undoubtedly a solemn impressive effect upon those outside
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0348-000.wav|the same was realized in the first private execution within newgate
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0349-000.wav|that of alexander mackay
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0349-001.wav|who murdered his mistress at norton fulgate
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0349-002.wav|by beating her with a rolling pin and furnace rake
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0350-001.wav|who expiated his crime on the eighth september eighteen sixty eight
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0351-000.wav|a more market change from the old scene can hardly be conceived
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0351-001.wav|instead of the roar of the brutalized crowd
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0352-000.wav|the officials spoke in whispers
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0352-001.wav|there was but little moving to and fro
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0353-000.wav|almost absolute silence prevailed until the great bell began to toll its deep note and broke the stillness with its regular and monotonous clangor
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0354-000.wav|and the ordinary
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0354-001.wav|in a voice trembling with emotion
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0354-002.wav|read the burial service aloud
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0355-000.wav|mackay's fortitude which had been great
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0356-000.wav|broke down at the supreme moment before the horror of the stillness the awful impressiveness of the scene
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0356-001.wav|in which he was the principal actor
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0357-000.wav|no time was lost in carrying out the dread ceremony
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0357-001.wav|it was not completed without some of the officials turning sick
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0357-002.wav|and the moment it was over
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0358-000.wav|all who could
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0358-001.wav|were glad to escape from the last act
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0358-002.wav|of the ghastly drama at which they had assisted
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0359-000.wav|private executions at their first introduction were not popular with the newgate officials and for intelligible reasons
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0360-000.wav|the change added greatly to the responsibilities of the governor and his subordinate
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0360-001.wav|hitherto the public had seemed to assist at the ceremony
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0361-000.wav|the moment too that the condemned man had passed through the debtors doors on to the scaffold the prison had done with him
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0362-000.wav|and the great outside world shared in the completion of the sacrifice
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0363-000.wav|this feeling was the stronger because
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0364-000.wav|all the ghastly paraphernalia

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0364-002.wav|rested with the city architect and not with the prison officials
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0365-000.wav|moreover
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0365-001.wav|after the execution under the old system the latter had only to receive the body for burial after it had been cut down by the hangman

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0049-001.wav|to scan his features and watch his demeanour through the shifting nicely balanced phases

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0115-000.wav|but it was proved
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0115-001.wav|the palmer tried hard
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0115-002.wav|to get possession of the jar containing them
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0116-000.wav|and even sought to upset the vehicle by which they were being conveyed a part of the way to london

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0117-001.wav|betrayed the presence of antimony in large quantities
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0117-002.wav|but no strychnia
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0118-000.wav|and it was on the entire absence of the latter
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0118-001.wav|that the defence was principally based
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0118-002.wav|when palmer was brought to trial

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0119-001.wav|but he could not escape the criminal charge

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0122-001.wav|and palmer was brought to newgate for trial
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0122-002.wav|at the central criminal court

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0125-001.wav|but he was confident

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0130-001.wav|he played the part of a man wrongfully convicted
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0130-002.wav|and did not abandon hope

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0134-001.wav|in which the murderer undoubtedly was inspired by the facts made public at palmer's trial

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0136-001.wav|and with a poison that would leave as he thought

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0137-000.wav|in the latter hope
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0137-001.wav|he was happily disappointed

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0137-003.wav|i merely mention it as one of the group already referred to

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0143-000.wav|which followed close on its heels

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0143-002.wav|in that the verdict of not guilty
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0143-003.wav|was excusable as the evidence was entirely circumstantial

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0144-002.wav|although

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0145-001.wav|and was tried at the central criminal court
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0146-000.wav|he had all the characteristics of the poisoner

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0147-001.wav|as with unshrinking relentless wickedness the deadly work is carried on to the end

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0151-001.wav|and to have as readily agreed to marry him
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0152-000.wav|in spite of the existence of the other missus smathurst
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0153-000.wav|probably the doctor had told her the story he brought forward when tried for bigamy

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0157-002.wav|and then at richmond
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0158-000.wav|she had a little fortune of her own

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0159-000.wav|and a life interest in five thousand pounds a fact on which smidhurst's counsel dwelt
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0159-001.wav|with much weight
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0160-000.wav|as indicating a motive for keeping her alive rather than killing her
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0161-000.wav|but probably the lump sum was the bait
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0161-001.wav|or perhaps smetherst wish to return to his temporarily deserted first wife

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0162-001.wav|cause which impelled him to

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0162-004.wav|that he began to give her some poison

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0163-001.wav|or antimony

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0164-000.wav|with the idea of subjecting her to the irritant poison slowly but surely
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0164-001.wav|until the desired effect death

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0165-000.wav|as she became worse and worse

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0169-001.wav|in a letter to the lord chief

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0175-000.wav|the circumstances were strange

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0177-002.wav|scrubped up while she was in newgate
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0178-000.wav|it appeared
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0178-001.wav|that several persons with whom she was intimate

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0179-000.wav|in all cases
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0179-001.wav|the symptoms were much the same
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0180-000.wav|vomiting
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0180-001.wav|violent wretching
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0180-002.wav|purging such as are visible in cholera
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0180-003.wav|and all dated from the time when she knew a young man named
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0181-000.wav|who had been in the habit
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0181-001.wav|of taking colchicum for rheumatism
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0181-002.wav|missus wilson heard then casually from a medical man
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0182-000.wav|that it was a very dangerous medicine
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0182-001.wav|and she profited by what she had heard
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0183-000.wav|soon afterwards dixon died
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0183-001.wav|showing all the symptoms already described
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0184-000.wav|soon afterwards a friend missus atkinson
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0184-001.wav|came to london from westmoreland
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0184-002.wav|and stayed in missus wilson's house
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0185-000.wav|she was in good health on leaving home
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0185-001.wav|and had with her a large sum of money
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0186-000.wav|while with missus wilson
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0186-001.wav|she became suddenly and alarmingly ill and died in great agony

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0187-001.wav|who came up to town
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0187-002.wav|would not allow a post mortem
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0187-003.wav|and again missus wilson escaped
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0188-000.wav|missus atkinson's symptoms had been the same as dixon's
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0188-001.wav|then missus wilson went to live with a man named taylor
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0189-000.wav|who was presently attacked in the same way as the others but
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0189-002.wav|thanks to the prompt administration of remedies
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0189-003.wav|he recovered
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0190-000.wav|after this came the charge of administering oil of vitriol which failed as has been described
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0191-000.wav|last of all missus wilson poisoned her landlady missus solmes
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0191-001.wav|under precisely the same conditions as the foregoing
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0192-000.wav|here however
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0192-001.wav|the evidence was strong
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0192-002.wav|and sufficient
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0193-000.wav|it was proved that missus wilson had given missus solmes something peculiar to drink
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0194-000.wav|that immediately afterwards
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0194-001.wav|missus solmes was taken ill with a vomiting and purging
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0195-001.wav|at missus wilson
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0195-002.wav|administered the same medicine
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0195-003.wav|again and again
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0196-000.wav|the last time missus solmes showed great reluctance to take it
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0196-001.wav|but wilson said it would certainly do her good
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0197-000.wav|this mysterious medicine wilson kept carefully locked up
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0197-001.wav|and allowed no one to see it
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0198-000.wav|but its nature was betrayed
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0198-001.wav|when this last victim also died
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0199-000.wav|the first post mortem indicated death from natural causes
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0200-000.wav|but a more careful investigation
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0200-001.wav|attributed it beyond doubt
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0200-002.wav|to overdoses
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0200-003.wav|of colchicum

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0201-003.wav|and in his evidence on the trial
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0202-000.wav|fairly electrified the court
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0202-001.wav|by declaring it his opinion
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0202-002.wav|that many deaths

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0202-004.wav|or really due
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0203-000.wav|this fact was referred to by the judge in his summing up
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0204-000.wav|who said that he feared it was only too true

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0205-002.wav|and suffered

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0207-000.wav|had not quite disappeared
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0207-001.wav|i will mention two cases of this class

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ018-0141-000.wav|led to the employment of the police
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ018-0141-001.wav|and the offer of a reward of fifteen hundred pounds

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ018-0145-001.wav|who had left laver stock
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ018-0146-000.wav|and he was soon approached by the police

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ018-0147-000.wav|the next step was to take the principles
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ018-0147-001.wav|and under such circumstances as would insure their conviction
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ018-0148-000.wav|a watch was set on burnette
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ018-0148-001.wav|who was followed to the shop of one

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ018-0151-000.wav|the police officers now taxed missus campbell with complicity
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ018-0151-001.wav|and frightened her into collusion
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ018-0152-000.wav|with her assistance on a certain day
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ018-0152-001.wav|a couple of bricks were taken out of the wall dividing her front and back parlors

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ018-0153-001.wav|and waited for buncher's expected visit

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ018-0154-001.wav|and he wanted a couple of hundred pounds for what he had

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ018-0155-001.wav|and there was an altercation
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ018-0155-002.wav|in the course of which
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ018-0155-003.wav|buncher became very violent
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ018-0155-004.wav|and at length
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ018-0156-000.wav|after using much intemperate language
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ018-0156-001.wav|he left the place
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ018-0156-002.wav|in a huss
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ018-0157-000.wav|in the course of his remarks however he said

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ018-0158-001.wav|that has got all the bank paper

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ018-0158-003.wav|and the bank of england cannot stop it

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ018-0305-002.wav|to have the date added

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ018-0316-001.wav|were to have been paid after the escape

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0102-001.wav|with the additional instruction to the committee
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0102-002.wav|to suggest any improvements

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0104-003.wav|inefficacious
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0105-000.wav|and that a new system of
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0105-001.wav|present discipline should be introduced
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0106-000.wav|his plan was to devote the whole labor of

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0107-000.wav|district prisons were to be established for this purpose
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0107-001.wav|each of which would be in the heart of a farm of a thousand acres

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0108-001.wav|and raised sufficient produce for their own support
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0109-000.wav|mister pearson backed up his recommendations by many sound argument

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0112-000.wav|such excellent returns might be counted upon
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0112-001.wav|that a margin of profit would be left after the cost of the prisons had been defrayed
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0113-000.wav|the scheme was no doubt fascinating and in many respects feasible
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0114-000.wav|but mister pearson overlooked some points
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0114-001.wav|in which a more practical mind would have foreseen difficulty
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0114-002.wav|and perhaps forecasted failure
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0115-000.wav|in his proposal
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0115-001.wav|he dwelt much
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0115-002.wav|upon the humanizing effects of healthful open air toil
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0116-000.wav|anticipating the best results
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0116-001.wav|from a system which made
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0116-002.wav|burnings
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0116-003.wav|and indeed release
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0116-004.wav|dependent upon the amount of work
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0117-000.wav|that industry might thus be stimulated and encouraged
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0117-001.wav|was probable enough
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0118-000.wav|and later experience has fully proved the advantage of a judicious system of gratuities for labor
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0119-001.wav|mister pearson hardly considered the converse sufficiently
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0120-000.wav|omitted the fact
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0120-001.wav|that he might have to deal with that persistent idleness
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0120-002.wav|which is not an unknown characteristic of the criminal class
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0121-000.wav|the hope of reward might do much
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0121-001.wav|but no system of penal discipline is complete
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0121-002.wav|unless it can also count upon
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0121-003.wav|the fear of

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0124-000.wav|thinking perhaps that prisoners so well disposed
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0124-001.wav|would cheerfully remain in jail of their own accord

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0125-002.wav|which some at least would have attempted
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0125-003.wav|probably with success
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0126-000.wav|the creation of an expensive staff for supervision
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0127-000.wav|or the still more costly process of walling in the whole farm

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0128-001.wav|some reference was indispensable to a scheme
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0129-000.wav|which marked the growth of public interest in prison affairs and which was the germ

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0132-001.wav|attention was again attracted to newgate

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0135-001.wav|or at worst but rarely

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0189-000.wav|this plan was on the principle of cellular separation
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0189-001.wav|a system according to lord john russell
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0189-002.wav|desirable in all prisons
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0190-000.wav|but in a metropolitan prison
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0190-001.wav|absolutely essential

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0190-003.wav|demurred
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0190-004.wav|rather to accepting strict separation as a rule
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0191-000.wav|feeling that it approached
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0191-001.wav|too nearly to solitary confinement
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0192-000.wav|the court was however prepared to consider lord john russell's proposal
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0192-001.wav|with regard to the cost of rebuilding
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0193-000.wav|but as the plan was confessedly experimental for the benefit of the country generally
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0193-001.wav|the amount for which the city should be responsible
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0193-002.wav|should be distinctly limited
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0194-000.wav|not to exceed a certain sum to be agreed upon
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0195-000.wav|a provisor was also made
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0195-001.wav|that the magistrates should continue to exercise full control over the new jail
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0196-000.wav|free from any other interference than that of the inspectors
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0196-001.wav|on the part of the government
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0197-000.wav|no doubt wiser counsels prevailed with lord john russell
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0198-000.wav|and on a more mature consideration he realized that the limited area of the existing newgate site
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0199-000.wav|and the costliness of enlarging it
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0199-001.wav|forbade all idea of entirely reconstructing the jail
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0199-002.wav|so as to constitute it
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0199-003.wav|a model prison
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0200-000.wav|it would be far better to begin at the beginning
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0201-000.wav|to select a sufficiently spacious piece of ground
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0201-001.wav|and erect a prison which
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0201-002.wav|from foundations to roofs
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0201-003.wav|should be in conformity with the newest ideas
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0202-000.wav|the preference given to the pentinville system destroyed all hopes of a complete reformation of newgate
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0203-000.wav|but the condition of the great city jail was evidently considered a reproach by the city authorities

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0205-001.wav|the jail committee brought forward
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0205-002.wav|a definite proposal
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0205-003.wav|to purchase ground in the immediate vicinity
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0205-004.wav|for the erection of a new jail
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0206-000.wav|this jail was nominally to replace the giltspur street compter
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0207-000.wav|the sight of which was to be sold
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0207-001.wav|to christ's hospital
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0207-002.wav|but the intention was of course
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0207-003.wav|to embody and absorb old newgate
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0207-004.wav|in the new construction
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0208-000.wav|the proposal made was to purchase some fifty thousand square feet
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0208-001.wav|between newgate

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0209-001.wav|to be salubrious
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0210-000.wav|but when this suggestion was brought before the court of aldermen
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0210-001.wav|various amendments were proposed
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0211-000.wav|it was urged
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0211-001.wav|that the areas selected for purchase must be excessively costly to acquire
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0211-002.wav|and still quite inadequate for the city needs
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0212-000.wav|the home secretary had laid it down that
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0212-001.wav|at least five acres would be indispensable
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0212-002.wav|and such an area it was impossible to obtain within the limits of the city

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0215-000.wav|why not move the city prison bodily into this more rural spot
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0215-001.wav|with its purer air and greater breathing space

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0217-002.wav|in eighteen forty nine
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0217-003.wav|when the works were commenced
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0218-000.wav|the prison was to contain four hundred and four prisoners
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0218-001.wav|and the estimated expenditure
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0218-002.wav|was seventy nine thousand pounds

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0220-000.wav|the uses of newgate were narrowed almost entirely
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0220-001.wav|to those of a prison of detention

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0391-000.wav|to close useless prisons

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0013-002.wav|out of the multitude of detailed parts that go into the making of the structure

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0028-000.wav|i am reminded sometimes
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0028-001.wav|of what president wilson once said
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0029-000.wav|so many people come to washington who know things that are not so
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0030-000.wav|and so few people who know anything about what the people of the united states are thinking about

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0032-001.wav|so that i can have a chance to think
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0032-002.wav|quietly about the country as a whole
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0033-000.wav|to get away from the trees as they say
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0033-001.wav|and to look at the whole forest
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0034-000.wav|this duty of seeing the country in a long range perspective
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0035-000.wav|is one which in a very special manner
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0035-001.wav|attaches to this office
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0035-002.wav|to which you have chosen me
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0036-000.wav|did you ever stop to think
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0036-001.wav|that there are after all
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0036-002.wav|only two positions in the nation
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0037-000.wav|that are filled by the vote of all the voters

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0037-002.wav|and the vice president
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0038-000.wav|that makes it particularly necessary for the vice president and for me
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0038-001.wav|to conceive of our duty toward the entire country
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0039-000.wav|i speak therefore to night
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0039-002.wav|and of the american people
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0039-003.wav|as a whole
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0040-000.wav|my most immediate concern
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0040-001.wav|is in carrying out the purposes of the great work programme just enacted by the congress
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0041-000.wav|its first objective is to put men and women now on the relief rolls to work
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0041-001.wav|and incidentally
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0042-000.wav|to assist materially
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0042-001.wav|in our already unmistakable march toward recovery
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0043-000.wav|i shall not confuse my discussion by a multitude of figures
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0043-001.wav|so many figures are quoted to prove so many things
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0044-000.wav|sometimes it depends upon what paper you read
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0044-001.wav|and what broadcast you hear
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0045-000.wav|therefore
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0045-001.wav|let us keep our minds
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0045-002.wav|on two or three simple
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0045-003.wav|essential facts in connection with this problem of unemployment
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0046-000.wav|it is true
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0046-001.wav|that while business and industry are definitely better
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0046-002.wav|our relief rolls are still too large
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0047-000.wav|however
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0047-001.wav|for the first time in five years
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0047-002.wav|the relief rolls have declined
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0047-003.wav|instead of increased
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0047-004.wav|during the winter months
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0048-000.wav|they are still declining
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0049-000.wav|the simple fact is that many million more people have private work to day
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0049-001.wav|than two years ago to day
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0049-002.wav|or one year ago to day
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0050-000.wav|and every day that passes
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0050-001.wav|offers more chances to work
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0050-002.wav|for those who want to work
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0051-000.wav|in spite of the fact that unemployment remains a serious problem
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0052-000.wav|here as in every other nation
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0052-001.wav|we have come to recognize the possibility
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0052-002.wav|and the necessity

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0052-004.wav|helpful remedial measures
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0053-000.wav|these measures are of two kinds
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0054-000.wav|the forest is to make provisions intended to relieve
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0054-001.wav|to minimise
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0054-002.wav|and to prevent future on employment
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0055-000.wav|the second is to establish the practical means
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0055-001.wav|to help those who are unemployed in this present emergency

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0057-001.wav|is a necessary part
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0057-002.wav|of the future unemployment policy of the government

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0059-001.wav|that we cannot continue to create governmental deficits for that purpose year after year

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ023-0018-003.wav|was to have a government with

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ023-0020-000.wav|we then began a programme of remedying those abuses and inequalities

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ024-0082-000.wav|would deny us the necessary means of dealing with the present
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ024-0083-000.wav|this plan of mine is no attack on the court

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ024-0093-000.wav|it would take months or years to get substantial agreement upon the type and language of the amendment

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ024-0110-001.wav|is to suggest the time consuming process of amendment

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0025-000.wav|he naturally sees the primary
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0025-001.wav|and the most important distinction
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0025-002.wav|between animals and plants
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0026-000.wav|following out his teleological argument
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0026-001.wav|couvier remarks that the organization of this cavity
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0027-000.wav|and its appurtenances must needs vary according to the nature of the element
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0027-001.wav|and the operations which it has to undergo
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0028-000.wav|before it can be converted into substances fitted for absorption
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0029-000.wav|while the atmosphere and the earth
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0029-001.wav|supply plants with juices
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0029-002.wav|ready prepared
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0029-003.wav|and which can be absorbed immediately
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0030-000.wav|as the animal body required
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0030-001.wav|to be independent of heat
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0030-002.wav|and of the atmosphere
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0031-000.wav|there were no means by which the motion of its fluids could be produced by internal causes
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0032-000.wav|hence arose the second great distinctive character of animals
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0032-002.wav|the circulatory system
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0032-003.wav|which is less important than the digestive
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0033-000.wav|since it was unnecessary
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0033-001.wav|and therefore is absent in the more simple animals
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0034-000.wav|animals further needed muscles for locomotion
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0034-001.wav|and nerves for sensibility
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0035-000.wav|hence says couvier
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0035-001.wav|it was necessary that the chemical composition of the animal body should be more complicated
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0035-002.wav|than that of the plant
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0036-000.wav|and it is so
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0036-001.wav|inasmuch as an additional substance

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0036-003.wav|enters into it as an essential element
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0037-000.wav|while in plants
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0037-001.wav|nitrogen is only accidentally joined
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0037-002.wav|with the three other fundamental constituents of organic
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0038-001.wav|hydrogen
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0038-002.wav|and oxygen
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0039-000.wav|he afterward affirms that

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0039-002.wav|and herein he places the third distinction between the animal and the plant

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0266-002.wav|and laying siege to the place

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0278-002.wav|went and saw the colt with his own eyes

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0282-000.wav|for it seemed to him

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0287-002.wav|and then went over to the enemy
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0288-000.wav|to do this seeming to him a like matter

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0289-003.wav|clipping his hair close and flogging himself with a scourge

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0300-000.wav|as it is i kept my own counsel and so accomplished my plans
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0301-000.wav|now therefore if there be no failure on thy part we shall take babylon
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0302-000.wav|i will desert to the enemy as i am

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0303-002.wav|must wait

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0304-001.wav|and then placed near to the gates of semi ramas a detachment of thy army

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0306-005.wav|at the nineve gate
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0307-001.wav|let twenty days pass

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0307-003.wav|stationed near the childean gates a body of four thousand
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0308-000.wav|let neither these nor the former troops be armed with any weapons but their swords

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0309-003.wav|and put me two bodies of persians

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0313-001.wav|whose business it was to keep a look out
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0314-000.wav|observing him
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0314-001.wav|hastened down
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0314-002.wav|and setting one of the gates slightly ajar
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0314-003.wav|questioned him who he was
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0314-004.wav|and on what errand he had come
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0315-000.wav|he replied that he was sapiras and deserted to them from the persians
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0316-000.wav|then the doorkeepers when they heard this carried him at once before the magistrates
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0317-000.wav|introduced into their assembly he began to bewail his misfortunes telling them that
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0318-000.wav|darius had nawtreated him in the way they could see
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0318-001.wav|only because he had given advice
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0318-002.wav|that the siege should be raised
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0318-003.wav|since there seemed no hope of taking ta city
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0319-000.wav|and now he went on to say
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0319-001.wav|my coming to you babylonians
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0320-000.wav|will prove the greatest game that you could possibly receive while to darius and the persians it will be the severest loss
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0321-001.wav|he by whom i have been so mutilated shall not escape unpunished and truly
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0321-002.wav|all the paths of his counsels are known to me
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0322-000.wav|thus did thopiraes speak
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0323-000.wav|the babylonians seeing a persian of such exalted rank in so grievous a plight
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0323-001.wav|his nose and ears cut off
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0324-000.wav|his body red with marks of scourging and with blood had no suspicion but that he spoke the truth and was really come to be their friend and helper
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0325-000.wav|they were ready therefore to grant him anything he asked
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0326-000.wav|and on his suing for a command they intrusted to him a body of troops with the help of which he proceeded to do as he had arranged with darious
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0327-000.wav|on the tenth day after his plight
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0327-001.wav|he led out his detachment
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0327-002.wav|and surrounding the thousand men
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0328-000.wav|whom darius according to agreement had sent first he fell upon them and slew them all
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0329-000.wav|then the babylonians
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0329-001.wav|seeing that his deeds were as brave as his words
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0329-002.wav|or beyond measure pleased
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0329-003.wav|and set no bounds to their trust
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0330-000.wav|and when the next period agreed on had elapsed
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0330-001.wav|again with a band of picked men
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0330-002.wav|he sallied forth
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0330-003.wav|and slaughtered the two thousand
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0331-000.wav|after this second exploit
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0331-001.wav|his praise was in all mouths
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0332-000.wav|once more however he waited
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0332-001.wav|till the interval appointed had gone by
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0332-002.wav|and then
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0332-003.wav|leading the troops to the place where the four thousand were
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0333-000.wav|he put them also to the sword
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0334-000.wav|this last victory gave him the finishing stroke to his power and made him all in all with the babylonians
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0335-000.wav|accordingly they committed to him the command of their whole army
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0335-001.wav|and put the keys of their city
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0335-002.wav|into his hands

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0337-000.wav|attacked the walls on every side
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0337-001.wav|whereupon zoparus played out the remainder of his stratagem
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0338-000.wav|while the babylonians crowding to the walls did their best to resist the persian assault
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0339-000.wav|he threw open the scissian and bellian gates and admitted the enemy

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0340-001.wav|took refuge in the temple of jupiter bellas
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0341-000.wav|the rest who did not see it
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0341-001.wav|kept at their posts
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0341-002.wav|till at last
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0341-003.wav|they too learned
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0341-004.wav|that they were betrayed
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0342-000.wav|thus was babylon taken for the second time
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0343-000.wav|darius having become master of the place
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0343-001.wav|destroyed the wall
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0343-002.wav|and tore down all the gates
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0344-000.wav|for cyrus had done neither the one
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0344-001.wav|nor the other when he took babylon
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0345-000.wav|he then chose out near three thousand of the leading citizens
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0345-001.wav|and caused them to be crucified
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0345-002.wav|while he allowed the remainder still to inhabit the city
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0346-001.wav|wishing to prevent the race of the babylonians from becoming extinct
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0347-000.wav|he provided wives for them in the room of those whom as i explained before they strangled to save their stores
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0348-000.wav|these he levied from the nations bordering on babylonia

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0350-001.wav|that the babylonians of our times are sprung
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0351-000.wav|as for zapyrus he was considered by darius to have surpassed
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0351-001.wav|in the greatness of his achievements
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0351-002.wav|all other persians

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0353-000.wav|darius as the story goes would often say that
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0353-001.wav|he had rather as a piraes were unmaimed
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0353-002.wav|then be master of twenty more babylons
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0354-000.wav|and he honoured thapirates greatly
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0354-001.wav|year by year he presented him with all the gifts which are held in most esteem among the persians
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0355-000.wav|he gave him likewise the government of babylon for his life

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0355-002.wav|and he also granted him many other favors

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0357-001.wav|that babylon was taken by darius only by use of stratagem

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ032-0189-000.wav|since there was limited if any opportunity

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ034-0123-000.wav|although brendan testified that the man in the window was standing when he fired the shots

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ034-0125-000.wav|it is understandable however for brendan to have believed that the man with the rifle was standing

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ034-0129-000.wav|establishes that they were either squatting

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ035-0028-000.wav|to the northwest corner of the floor where truly hoped to find one of the two freight elevators

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ035-0035-000.wav|because the stairway itself is enclosed

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ035-0035-002.wav|could see anything on the second floor hallway
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ035-0035-003.wav|until they reached the landing at the top of the stairs

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ035-0037-002.wav|into the second floor lunch room

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ035-0041-001.wav|he caught a fleeting glimpse of a man

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ035-0042-000.wav|since the vestibule door is only a few feet from the lunch room door

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ035-0047-003.wav|and it looked to me like he was going away from me

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ036-0086-000.wav|the commission could not accept important elements of kraig's testimony

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ036-0090-000.wav|if craig saw oswald that afternoon

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ036-0096-000.wav|because of the overwhelming evidence that oswald was far away from the building by that time

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ036-0106-000.wav|you could have picked him out without identifying him by just listening to him
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ036-0107-000.wav|because he was bawling out the policeman

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ036-0131-000.wav|and about that time an old lady i think she was an old lady i don't remember nothing but her sticking her head down past him in the door and said
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ036-0132-000.wav|driver will you call me a cab down here
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ036-0132-001.wav|she had seen him get this cab and she wanted one too

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ036-0134-000.wav|i asked him where he wanted to go
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ036-0134-001.wav|and he said five hundred north backley
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ036-0134-002.wav|well i started up
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ036-0135-000.wav|i started to that address
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ036-0135-001.wav|and the police cars the sirens was going running criss crossing everywhere just a big uproar in that end of town and i said
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ036-0136-000.wav|what the hallet i wonder what the hill is the uproar
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ036-0137-000.wav|an he never said anything
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ036-0137-001.wav|so i figured he was one of these people i don't like to talk so i never said any more to
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ036-0138-000.wav|but when i got pretty close to five hundred blocket meches and north beckley which is the five hundred block he said this will do fine
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ036-0138-001.wav|and i pulled over to the curb right there

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ038-0085-001.wav|is presented in chapter five of this report
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ038-0086-000.wav|during the evening of november twenty two the daolist police department performed paraffin tests on oswald's hands and right cheek
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ038-0087-000.wav|in an apparent effort to determine

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ038-0087-003.wav|whether oswald had recently fired a weapon
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ038-0088-000.wav|the results were positive for the hands and negative for the right cheek

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ038-0090-000.wav|was to the effect that
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ038-0090-001.wav|the paraffin test was unreliable
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ038-0090-002.wav|in determining whether or not a person has fired a rifle or revolver
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ038-0091-000.wav|the commission has therefore
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ038-0091-001.wav|placed no reliance on the paraffin tests administered by the daloliss police
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ038-0092-000.wav|oswald provided little information during his questioning
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ038-0093-000.wav|frequently however he was confronted with evidence which he could not explain
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ038-0093-001.wav|and he resorted to statements which are known to be lies
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ038-0094-000.wav|while oswald's untrue statements during interrogation were not considered items of positive proof
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ038-0095-000.wav|by the commission they had probitive value
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ038-0095-001.wav|in deciding the weight to be given to his denials that he assassinated president kennedy
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ038-0096-000.wav|and killed pertrol and tippet
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ038-0096-001.wav|since independent evidence revealed that oswald repeatedly and blatantly lied to the police

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ039-0208-000.wav|this was because of a defect in the scope which was recognized by the f beind agents

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ039-0210-003.wav|but that a person familiar with the weapon could compensate for it

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ039-0211-001.wav|the defect was one which would have assisted the assassin

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ039-0212-000.wav|frager said
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ039-0212-002.wav|the fact that the cross hairs are set high would actually compensate
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ039-0212-003.wav|for any lead which had to be taken
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ039-0213-000.wav|so that if you aimed with this weapon as it actually was received at the laboratory
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ039-0213-001.wav|it would not be necessary to take any lead whatsoever

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ039-0217-001.wav|that the assassination rifle
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ039-0217-002.wav|was an accurate weapon

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ039-0219-000.wav|fraser testified that the rifle was accurate
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ039-0219-001.wav|that it had less recoil than the average military rifle

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ039-0221-001.wav|that the manloqer cork cano was an accurate rifle
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ039-0221-002.wav|and that the use of a four power scope
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ039-0222-000.wav|was a substantial aid to rapid accurate firing

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0024-001.wav|is that oswald was profoundly alienated from the world in which he lived

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0030-000.wav|when he was in the soviet union

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0035-001.wav|he sometimes imagined himself as quoth the commander

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0036-001.wav|seriously as a political prophet

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0050-001.wav|was probably in some measure
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0050-002.wav|an expression of his hostility to his environment
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0051-000.wav|while there is doubt about how fully oswald understood the doctrine which he so often espoused

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0053-002.wav|and it probably influenced his decision to shoot a general walker

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0084-000.wav|dwelling on the fact that she was a widow with three children

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0086-000.wav|in the fall of nineteen forty eight
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0086-001.wav|she told john pick
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0086-002.wav|and robert oswald
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0087-000.wav|but she could not afford to send them back to the military school and she asked pick to quit school entirely to help support the family
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0088-000.wav|which he did for four months in the fall of nineteen forty eight

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0089-001.wav|she falsely swore that pick was seventeen years old
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0089-002.wav|so that he could join the marine corps reserves
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0090-000.wav|pick did turn over part of his income to his mother
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0091-000.wav|but he returned to high school in january of nineteen forty nine
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0091-001.wav|where he stayed until three days before he was scheduled

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0092-000.wav|when he left school
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0092-001.wav|in order to get into the coastguard
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0092-002.wav|since his mother did not approve of his decision to continue school
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0093-000.wav|he accepted the responsibility for that decision himself and signed his mother's name to all his own excuses and report cards
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0094-000.wav|pick thought that his mother overstated her financial problems
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0094-001.wav|and was unduly concerned about money
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0095-000.wav|referring to the period after the divorce from ecdole
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0095-001.wav|which was apparently caused in part by marguerite's desire to get more money from him

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0100-001.wav|apparently leaving him alone in the car
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0100-002.wav|while she transacted her business
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0101-000.wav|when she worked during the school year
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0101-001.wav|we had to leave an empty house in the morning

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0103-000.wav|an indication of the nature of lee's character at this time
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0103-001.wav|was provided in the spring of nineteen fifty
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0104-000.wav|when he was sent to new orleans to visit the family of his mother's sister

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0106-000.wav|it also appears that lee tried to tag along with his older brothers
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0107-000.wav|but apparently
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0107-001.wav|was not able to spend as much time with them
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0107-002.wav|as he would have liked
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0107-003.wav|because of the age gaps of five and seven years
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0108-000.wav|which became more significant as the children grew older
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0109-000.wav|whatever problems may have been created by lee's home life in louisiana and texas
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0110-000.wav|he apparently adjusted well enough there
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0110-001.wav|to have had an average although gradually deteriorating school record
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0111-000.wav|with no behaviour or truancy problems
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0112-000.wav|that was not the case however
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0112-001.wav|after he and his mother moved to new york
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0112-002.wav|in august of nineteen fifty two

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0116-000.wav|who was becoming quite a disciplinary problem for his mother

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0116-002.wav|on at least one occasion

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0106-000.wav|at the court martial hearing which followed
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0106-001.wav|oswald admitted
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0106-002.wav|that he had been rather drunk when the incident occurred

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0107-001.wav|he had felt the sergeant had a grudge against him
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0107-002.wav|and that he had unsuccessfully sought a transfer from the sergeant's unit
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0108-000.wav|he said that he had simply wanted to discuss the questionith

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0108-002.wav|and the drink had been spilled accidentally

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0109-001.wav|but found oswald guilty
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0109-002.wav|of wrongfully using provoking words

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0115-002.wav|following his transfer from active duty
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0116-000.wav|after it was learned
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0116-001.wav|that he had defected to the soviet union
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0117-000.wav|in an attempt to have this discharge reversed

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0118-001.wav|to then secretary of the navy connolly
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0118-002.wav|on january thirty

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0119-000.wav|stating that he would quote
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0119-001.wav|employ all means to write this gross mistake or injustice and quote

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0120-004.wav|that he had forwarded the letter
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0120-005.wav|to his successor
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0121-000.wav|it is thus clear
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0121-001.wav|that oswald knew that governor connolly
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0121-002.wav|was never directly concerned with his discharge
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0122-000.wav|and he must have known that president kennedy
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0122-001.wav|had had nothing to do with it
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0123-000.wav|in that connection
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0123-001.wav|it does not appear that oswald ever expressed
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0123-002.wav|any dissatisfaction of any kind
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0123-003.wav|with either the president
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0123-004.wav|or governor connolly
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0124-000.wav|marina oswald testified that she quote had never heard anything bad about kennedy from lee
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0124-001.wav|and he never had anything against him
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0124-002.wav|and quoth
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0125-000.wav|missus oswald said
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0125-001.wav|that her husband did not say anything about governor connolly after his return to the united states

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0126-000.wav|but while we were in russia he spoke well of him
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0126-001.wav|least sir that when
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0126-002.wav|he would return to the united states
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0126-003.wav|he would vote for him for governor
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0127-000.wav|oswald must have already learned that the governor could not help him with his discharge
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0127-001.wav|because he was no longer secretary of the navy
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0127-002.wav|at the time he made that remark
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0128-000.wav|even though oswald apparently did not express any hostility against the president or governor connolly
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0129-000.wav|he continued to be concerned about his undesirable discharge
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0129-001.wav|it is clear that he thought he had been unjustly treated
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0130-000.wav|probably his complaint was due to the fact
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0130-001.wav|that his discharge was not related
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0130-002.wav|to anything he had done while unactive
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0131-000.wav|and also
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0131-001.wav|because he had not received any notice of the original discharge proceedings
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0131-002.wav|since his whereabouts were not known
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0132-000.wav|he continued his efforts to reverse the discharge
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0132-001.wav|by petitioning the navy discharged review board
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0133-000.wav|which finally declined
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0133-001.wav|to modify the discharge
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0133-002.wav|and so advised him in a letter dated july
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0133-003.wav|nineteen sixty
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0134-000.wav|governor connolly's connection with the discharge although indirect
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0134-002.wav|the commission to consider whether he might have been oswald's real target
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0135-000.wav|in that connection
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0135-001.wav|it should be noted that
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0135-002.wav|marina oswald testified on september sixth nineteen sixty four
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0135-003.wav|that she thought her husband quote
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0136-000.wav|was shooting at connolly rather than president kennedy
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0136-001.wav|and quote
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0137-000.wav|in support of her conclusion
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0137-001.wav|missus oswald noted her husband's undesirable discharge
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0138-000.wav|and that she could not think of any reason why oswald would want to kill president kennedy
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0139-000.wav|it should be noted however
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0139-001.wav|at the time oswald fired the shots at the presidential limousine
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0139-002.wav|the governor occupied the seat in front of them

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0140-000.wav|and it would have been almost impossible

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0140-002.wav|to have hit the governor
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0140-003.wav|without hitting the president first
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0141-000.wav|oswald could have shot the governor as the car approached the depository
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0141-001.wav|or as it was making the turn onto

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0142-000.wav|once it had started down elm street toward the triple underpass however
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0143-000.wav|the president almost completely blocked oswald's view of the governor
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0143-001.wav|prior to the time the first shot struck

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0144-000.wav|oswald would have had other and more favorable opportunities to strike at the governor

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0144-002.wav|as a member of the president's party
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0145-000.wav|he had more protection than usual
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0145-001.wav|it would appear therefore that
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0145-002.wav|to the extent

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0148-000.wav|as indicated above

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0178-002.wav|donovan testified

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0182-002.wav|but was not in favor of quote

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0186-000.wav|as some kind of tribunal
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0187-000.wav|and he wanted to be on the winning side so that ten thousand years from now

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0188-001.wav|the eyes of god
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0189-000.wav|he was concerned with his image in history and i do think that is why he chose
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0189-001.wav|the particular method of defecting
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0189-002.wav|he chose
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0189-003.wav|and did it in the way he did

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0191-000.wav|thoreignly thought that oswald not only wanted a place in history

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0192-000.wav|he testified that
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0192-001.wav|if oswald could not have that quote degree of physical comfort that he expected or sought
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0193-000.wav|i think he would then throw himself entirely on the other thing he also wanted

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0194-001.wav|if he didn't he wanted to die with the knowledge that
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0194-002.wav|or with the idea that he was somebody
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0194-003.wav|and quoth
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0195-000.wav|oswald's interest in marxism led some people to avoid him

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0196-001.wav|that interest may have been motivated by a desire to gain attention
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0196-002.wav|he used his marksist at associated activities
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0197-000.wav|as excuses for his difficulties in getting along in the world

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0199-001.wav|turned from the soviet union
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0199-002.wav|of course
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0199-003.wav|he made his real problems worse to the extent
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0200-000.wav|that his use of those excuses
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0200-001.wav|prevented him from discovering the real reasons for

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ042-0007-001.wav|oswald thus committed an act which was the most striking indication he had yet given

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0165-002.wav|that he had considered

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0169-001.wav|with his wife's testimony that quote

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0170-001.wav|what for he was making all these entries in the book
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0170-002.wav|and he answered that he wanted to leave a complete record
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0170-003.wav|so that all the details would be in it
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0171-000.wav|i am guessing that perhaps he did it to appear to be a brave man in case he were arrested
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0171-001.wav|but that is my supposition
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0171-002.wav|and quote
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0172-000.wav|the attempt on general walker's life
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0172-001.wav|deserves close attention in any consideration of oswald's possible motive for the assassination
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0173-000.wav|and the trail of evidence he left behind him on that occasion
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0174-000.wav|while there are differences between the two events as far as oswald's

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0174-002.wav|there are also similarities that should be considered
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0175-000.wav|the items which oswald left at home when he made his attack on walker
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0175-001.wav|suggest a strong concern for his place in history
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0176-000.wav|if the attack had succeeded
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0176-001.wav|and oswald had been caught

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0179-001.wav|coupled with other indications that oswald was concerned about his place in history
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0180-000.wav|and with the circumstances surrounding the assassination
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0180-001.wav|have led the commission to believe

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0185-001.wav|may be found in the nature of the motive that he stated

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ044-0225-000.wav|it should also be noted however

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ044-0225-002.wav|shortly before the assassination
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ044-0226-000.wav|oswald had expressed approval of president kennedy's active role in the area of civil rights
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ044-0227-000.wav|although oswald could possibly have been motivated in part
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ044-0227-001.wav|by his sympathy for the castoral government
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ044-0228-000.wav|it should be remembered
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ044-0228-001.wav|that his wife testified that he was disappointed with his failure to get to cuba
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ044-0229-000.wav|and had lost his desire to do so because of the bureaucracy and red tape which he had encountered
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ044-0230-000.wav|his unhappy experience with the cuban consul seems thus to have reduced his enthusiasm for the castoral regime

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ044-0231-001.wav|might have led oswald to believe that he would be well received in cuba

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ044-0233-001.wav|although he had left apparently by design

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0200-001.wav|he did think about his wife's request

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0203-001.wav|in the marine core
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0203-002.wav|in his ideal of communism

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0203-004.wav|and in his attempt to get to cuba
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0204-000.wav|he had never found anything to which he felt

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0205-000.wav|after he returned from his trip to mexico
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0205-001.wav|where his application to go to cuba had been sharply rejected
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0206-000.wav|it must have appeared to him that he was unable to command even the attention of his family

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0208-000.wav|his family lived with missus payne
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0208-001.wav|ostensibly because oswald could not afford to keep an apartment indowlis
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0209-000.wav|but it was also at least in part
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0209-001.wav|because his wife did not want to live there with him
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0210-000.wav|now it appeared that he was not welcome at the paint home
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0211-000.wav|where he had spent every previous week end since his return from mexico
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0211-001.wav|and his wife was once again calling in to question his judgment

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0214-002.wav|to talk to him
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0214-003.wav|although he may long before have decided on the course he was to follow
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0215-000.wav|and may have told his wife the things he did on the evening of november twenty one

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0216-001.wav|merely to disarm her and to provide a justification of sorts

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0217-001.wav|thought he had come home to make up
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0217-002.wav|after the fight on monday
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0218-000.wav|thoughts of his personal difficulties must have been at least partly on his mind
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0218-001.wav|when he went to irving on thursday night
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0218-002.wav|and told his wife that he was lonely
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0219-000.wav|that he wanted to make peace with her
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0219-001.wav|and bring his family to dalis where they could live with him again
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0220-000.wav|the commission does not believe that the relations between oswald and his wife
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0220-001.wav|caused him to assassinate the president
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0221-000.wav|it is unlikely that the motivation was that simple
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0222-000.wav|the feelings of hostility and aggression
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0222-001.wav|which seemed to have played such an important part in oswald's life

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0223-001.wav|long before he met his wife
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0224-000.wav|and such a favorable opportunity to strike at a figure as great as the president would probably never have come to him again

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0225-001.wav|throws a little light on his motives
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0226-000.wav|the fact that he took so little money with him when he left irving in the morning
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0226-001.wav|indicates that he did not expect to get very far from dalis on his own
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0227-000.wav|and suggests the possibility
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0227-001.wav|as did his note to his wife just prior to the attempt on general walker

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0228-001.wav|he could have travelled some distance with the money he did have
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0228-002.wav|and he did return to his room where he obtained his revolver
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0229-000.wav|he then killed patrolm and tippet
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0229-001.wav|when that police officer apparently tried to question him after he had left his rooming house and he vigorously resisted arrest

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ047-0178-000.wav|because she thought the f beyind was in possession of a great deal of information

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0182-001.wav|the commission has concluded
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0182-002.wav|that the secret service particularly tends to be the passive recipient of information
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0183-000.wav|regarding such threats and that
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0183-001.wav|its protective research section
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0183-002.wav|is not adequately staffed or equipped
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0184-000.wav|to conduct the wider investigative work that is required to day for the security of the president
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0185-000.wav|during the period the commission was giving thought to this situation
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0186-000.wav|the commission received a number of proposals designed to improve current arrangements for protecting the president
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0187-000.wav|these proposals
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0187-001.wav|included suggestions to locate exclusive responsibility for all phases of the work
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0188-000.wav|in one or another government agency
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0188-001.wav|to clarify the division of authority between the agencies involved
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0188-002.wav|and to retain the existing system
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0189-000.wav|but expand both the scope
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0189-001.wav|and the operations are the existing agencies

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0190-000.wav|it has been pointed out
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0190-001.wav|that the f be i as our chief investigative agency
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0191-000.wav|is properly manned and equipped
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0191-001.wav|to carry on extensive information gathering functions within the united states
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0192-000.wav|it was also suggested
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0192-001.wav|that it would take a substantial period of time for the secret service to build up the experience and skills necessary
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0192-002.wav|to meet the problem
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0193-000.wav|consequently
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0193-001.wav|the suggestion has been made on the one hand
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0193-002.wav|that all preventive
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0193-003.wav|investigative functions relating to the security of the president
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0194-000.wav|should be transferred to the f bei
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0195-000.wav|leaving with the secret service
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0195-001.wav|only the responsibility for the physical protection of the president
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0195-002.wav|that is the guarding function alone
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0196-000.wav|on the other hand
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0196-001.wav|it is urged
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0196-002.wav|that all features of the protection of the president and his family
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0196-003.wav|should be committed to anelete and independent corps
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0197-000.wav|it is also contended
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0197-001.wav|that the agents should be intimately associated with the life of the presidential family
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0198-000.wav|in all its ramifications and alert to every danger that might befall it
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0199-000.wav|and ready at any instant to hazard great danger to themselves in the performance of their tremendous responsibility
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0200-000.wav|it is suggested
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0200-001.wav|that an organization shorn of its power to investigate all the possibilities of danger to the president
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0201-000.wav|and becoming merely the recipient of information gathered by others would become limited solely to acts of physical alertness and personal courage
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0202-000.wav|incident to its responsibilities
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0203-000.wav|so circumscribed
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0203-001.wav|it could not maintain the esprit de corps or the necessary alertness for this unique
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0203-002.wav|and challenging responsibility
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0204-000.wav|while in accordance with its mandate
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0205-000.wav|this commission has necessarily examined into the functioning of the various federal agencies
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0205-001.wav|concerned with a tragic trip of president kennedy to dalis
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0206-000.wav|and while it has arrived at certain conclusions in respect there too it seems clear
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0207-000.wav|that it was not within the commission's responsibility to make specific recommendations as to the long range organization
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0207-001.wav|of the president's protection
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0208-000.wav|except as conclusions flowing directly from its examination

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0208-002.wav|can be drawn
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0209-000.wav|the commission was not asked
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0209-001.wav|to apply itself as did the hoover commission in nineteen forty nine
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0210-000.wav|for examples to a determination of the optimum organization of the president's protection
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0211-000.wav|it would have been necessary for the commission to take considerable testimony

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0212-000.wav|to put it in a position to reach final conclusions in this respect
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0213-000.wav|there are always dangers of divided responsibility
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0214-000.wav|duplication and confusion of authority

/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0214-002.wav|but on the other hand
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0215-000.wav|the protection of the president is in a real sense
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0215-001.wav|a government wide responsibility
/mnt/workspace/chunkspeech/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0215-002.wav|which must necessarily
