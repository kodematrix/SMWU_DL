/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0014-002.wav|when the craftsmen took care that beautiful form should always be a part of their productions

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0017-000.wav|that teforms or

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0032-002.wav|had a transition between
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0032-003.wav|gothic and roman
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0033-000.wav|but which must certainly have come from the study of the twelfth

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0036-001.wav|about the same year

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0040-002.wav|but it is by no means without beauty
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0041-000.wav|it must be said
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0041-001.wav|that it is in no way like the transition type of subiaco
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0042-000.wav|and though more roman than that

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0172-001.wav|books is too wide a subject to be dealt with
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0172-002.wav|fully here
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0172-003.wav|but one thing must be said on it
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0173-000.wav|the essential point to be remembered
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0173-001.wav|is that the ornament
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0173-002.wav|whatever it is
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0173-003.wav|whether picture or pattern work
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0173-004.wav|should form part of the page
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0174-000.wav|should be a part of the whole scheme of the book
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0175-000.wav|simple as this proposition is
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0175-001.wav|it is necessary to be stated
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0176-000.wav|because the modern practice is to disregard the relation between the printing and the ornament altogether
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0177-000.wav|so that if the two are helpful to one another
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0177-001.wav|it is a mere matter of accident
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0178-000.wav|the due relation of letter
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0178-001.wav|to pictures and other ornament
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0178-002.wav|was thoroughly understood by the old printers
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0178-003.wav|so that
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0179-000.wav|even when the wood cuts are very rude indeed
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0180-000.wav|the proportions of the page
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0180-001.wav|still give pleasure
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0180-002.wav|by the sense of richness that the
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0180-003.wav|cuts and letter together convey
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0181-000.wav|when
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0181-001.wav|as is most often the case
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0181-002.wav|there is actual beauty in the cods
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0182-000.wav|the books so ornamented
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0182-001.wav|are amongst the most delightful works of art
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0182-002.wav|that have ever been produced
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0183-000.wav|therefore

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0183-003.wav|and proper position of the page on the paper
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0184-000.wav|all books might be at least comely and well looking

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ001-0185-000.wav|printed books might once again illustrate to the full

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ008-0262-001.wav|this dispatch amounted to undue precipitancy

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ008-0266-000.wav|thus in the years between may first eighteen twenty seven and thirtieth april eighteen thirty one

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ008-0270-000.wav|and while the courts adhered to the letter of the law appeals were constantly made to the royal prerogative of mercy

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ013-0198-001.wav|in an impassioned address
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ013-0198-002.wav|implored the jury not to send an innocent man to the gallows

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ013-0203-000.wav|on his removal to newgate after sentence
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ013-0204-000.wav|he admitted that he had been justly convicted
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ013-0204-001.wav|and expressed great anxiety that his fellow servants should be relieved from all suspicion

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ013-0206-000.wav|next morning he made a full confession
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ013-0206-001.wav|in presence of his attorney
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ013-0206-002.wav|and the governor mister cope

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ013-0207-001.wav|he gave as the motives of his crime a quarrel he had with his master

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ013-0209-000.wav|he was annoyed with his man for various small omissions and acts of forgetfulness

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0095-000.wav|the blow fell suddenly and when least expected
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0095-001.wav|one morning mister fasson asked casually for certain certificates

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0096-001.wav|but they were certificates connected in some way with robson's long practised frauds
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0097-000.wav|and he could not produce them

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0100-001.wav|did the honors of his house
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0100-002.wav|rang for lunch to gain time
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0101-000.wav|but at mister fasson's pressing demands went upstairs to fetch the certificates
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0102-000.wav|he came back to explain that he had mislaid them

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0105-002.wav|discovered his flight
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0106-000.wav|and lenard
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0106-001.wav|was forthwith offered for robson's apprehension

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0107-001.wav|the absconding clerk had coolly driven to a favorite dining place in the west end

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0108-001.wav|and a brace of partridges were set before him
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0109-000.wav|and he discussed the latter with appetite
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0109-001.wav|but begged
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0109-002.wav|that they would never give him curry again as he did not like it
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0110-000.wav|after dinner he went into hiding for a day or two
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0111-000.wav|then accompanied by a lady not missus robson
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0111-001.wav|he took steamer and started for copenhagen
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0112-000.wav|but the continental police had been warned to look out for him
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0112-001.wav|and two danish inspectors got upon his track
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0113-000.wav|followed him over to sweden
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0113-001.wav|and arrested him
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0113-002.wav|at helsingforce
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0114-000.wav|thence he was transferred to copenhagen and surrendered in due course to a london police officer

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0115-002.wav|and to have at once resigned himself to his fate
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0116-000.wav|when brought to trial he took matters very coolly
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0116-001.wav|and at first pleaded not guilty
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0116-002.wav|but subsequently withdrew the plea
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0117-000.wav|sergeant valentine who prosecuted
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0118-000.wav|paid him the compliment of describing him as
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0118-001.wav|a young man of great intelligence considerable powers of mind

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0123-000.wav|in many respects
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0123-001.wav|the embezzlement of which leopold redpath was guilty
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0123-002.wav|closely resembled that of robson
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0124-000.wav|but it was based upon more extended
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0124-001.wav|and audacious forgeries
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0125-000.wav|redpath's crime arose from his peculiar and independent position as registrar of stock

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0126-000.wav|this offered him great facilities for the creation of artificial stock

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0126-002.wav|and transferred to himself

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0127-001.wav|were forged
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0127-002.wav|not only did he thus transfer and realize

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0128-000.wav|but he bought botified amount
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0128-001.wav|and increase their value by altering the figures
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0129-000.wav|by inserting say one
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0129-001.wav|before five hundred
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0129-002.wav|and thus making it

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0278-000.wav|commencing sham actions and

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ015-0287-001.wav|but to give timely notice if it was not

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0042-004.wav|to the railing below the shabeau de freze

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ016-0045-001.wav|reached a point opposite the top of the building containing the condemned wards

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0115-001.wav|that palmer tried hard to get possession of the jar containing them

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0118-000.wav|and it was on the entire absence of the latter
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0118-001.wav|that the defence was principally based when palmer was brought to trial

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0129-001.wav|he clung to the hope that the government would grant him a reprieve

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0130-001.wav|he played the part of a man wrongfully convicted
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0130-002.wav|and did not abandon hope

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0136-001.wav|and with a poison that would leave as he thought

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0137-000.wav|in the latter hope
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0137-001.wav|he was happily disappointed
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0137-002.wav|but as this case is beyond my subject
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0137-003.wav|i merely mention it as one of the group already referred to

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0139-002.wav|and both raised difficult questions of medical jurisprudence
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0140-000.wav|in both the jury had no doubt as to the guilt of the accused

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0143-001.wav|in that the verdict of not guilty
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0143-002.wav|was excusable as the evidence was entirely circumstantial

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0153-000.wav|probably the doctor had told her the story he brought forward when tried for bigamy namely

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0154-001.wav|had no right to the name
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0154-002.wav|but had a husband of her own one johnson

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0155-001.wav|no less than the repudiation of the other marriage
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0156-000.wav|and told her sister as much when they last met

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0160-000.wav|as indicating a motive for keeping her alive rather than killing her
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0161-000.wav|but probably the lump sum was the bait
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0161-001.wav|or perhaps smetherst wish to return to his temporarily deserted first wife

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0162-001.wav|that he began to give her some poison
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0163-000.wav|either arcenic
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0163-001.wav|or antimony

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0164-000.wav|with the idea of subjecting her to the irritant poison slowly but surely

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0180-003.wav|and all dated from the time when she knew a young man named
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0180-004.wav|dixon
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0181-000.wav|who had been in the habit of taking colchicum for rheumatism
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0181-001.wav|missus wilson heard then casually from a medical man
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0182-000.wav|that it was a very dangerous medicine
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0182-001.wav|and she profited by what she had heard
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0183-000.wav|soon afterwards dixon died
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0183-001.wav|showing all the symptoms already described
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0184-000.wav|soon afterwards a friend missus atkinson
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0184-001.wav|came to london from westmoreland
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0184-002.wav|and stayed in missus wilson's house
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0185-000.wav|she was in good health on leaving home
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0185-001.wav|and had with her a large sum of money
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0186-000.wav|while with missus wilson
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0186-001.wav|she became suddenly and alarmingly ill and died in great agony
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0187-000.wav|her husband who came up to town
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0187-001.wav|would not allow a post mortem
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0187-002.wav|and again missus wilson escaped
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0188-000.wav|missus atkinson's symptoms had been the same as dixon's
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0188-001.wav|then missus wilson went to live with a man named taylor
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0189-000.wav|who was presently attacked in the same way as the others but
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0189-001.wav|but thanks to the prompt administration of remedies he recovered
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0190-000.wav|after this came the charge of administering oil of vitriol which failed as has been described
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0191-000.wav|last of all missus wilson poisoned her landlady missus solmes under precisely the same conditions as the foregoing
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0192-000.wav|here however
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0192-001.wav|the evidence was strong
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0192-002.wav|and sufficient
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0193-000.wav|it was proved that missus wilson had given missus solmes something peculiar to drink
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0194-000.wav|that immediately afterwards missus solmes was taken ill with vomiting and purging
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0195-000.wav|and that missus wilson administered the same medicine again and again
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0196-000.wav|the last time missus solmes showed great reluctance to take it but wilson said it would certainly do her good
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0197-000.wav|this mysterious medicine wilson kept carefully locked up and allowed no one to see it
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0198-000.wav|but its nature was betrayed when this last victim also died
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0199-000.wav|the first post mortem indicated death from natural causes
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0200-000.wav|but a more careful investigation attributed it beyond doubt to over doses of colchicum
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0201-000.wav|doctor alfred taylor the great authority and writer on medical jurisprudence
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0201-001.wav|corroborated this
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0201-002.wav|and in his evidence on the trial
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0202-000.wav|fairly electrified the court
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0202-001.wav|by declaring it his opinion
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0202-002.wav|that many deaths
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0202-003.wav|supposed to be from cholera

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0203-000.wav|this fact was referred to by the judge in his summing up
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0204-000.wav|who said that he feared it was only too true

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ017-0207-001.wav|i will mention two cases of this class

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ018-0250-000.wav|but at the same time with an air of the most entire truthfulness

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0100-002.wav|to the following year
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0101-000.wav|in eighteen fifty

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0101-002.wav|brought forward a new motion to the same effect
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0102-000.wav|which was promptly carried
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0102-001.wav|with the additional instruction to the committee
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0102-002.wav|to suggest any improvements
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0103-000.wav|the latter had reference more especially
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0103-001.wav|to a proposal emanating from mister charles pearson himself
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0104-000.wav|that gentleman had come to the conclusion

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0104-002.wav|or practically
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0104-003.wav|inefficacious
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0105-000.wav|and that a new system of prison discipline should be introduced
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0106-000.wav|his plan was to devote the whole labor of prisoners
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0106-001.wav|sentenced
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0106-002.wav|to any term between three months and four years
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0106-003.wav|to agriculture
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0107-000.wav|district prisons were to be established for this purpose
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0107-001.wav|each of which would be in the heart of a farm of a thousand acres
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0108-000.wav|the prisoners were to cultivate the land
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0108-001.wav|and raised sufficient produce for their own support
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0109-000.wav|mister pearson backed up his recommendations by many sound argument
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0110-000.wav|field labor he urged
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0110-001.wav|and with reason
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0110-002.wav|was a very suitable employment
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0111-000.wav|howthful
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0111-001.wav|easily learnt
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0111-002.wav|and well adapted
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0111-003.wav|to the circumstances of unskilled laborers
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0112-000.wav|such excellent returns might be counted upon
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0112-001.wav|that a margin of profit would be left after the cost of the prisons had been defrayed
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0113-000.wav|the scheme was no doubt fascinating and in many respects feasible
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0114-000.wav|but mister pearson overlooked some points in which a more practical mind would have foreseen difficulty and perhaps forecasted failure
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0115-000.wav|in his proposal
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0115-001.wav|he dwelt much upon the humanizing effects of healthful open air toil
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0116-000.wav|anticipating the best results
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0116-001.wav|from a system which made earnings and indeed relief
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0116-002.wav|dependent upon the amount of work done
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0117-000.wav|that industry might thus be stimulated and encouraged
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0117-001.wav|was probable enough
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0118-000.wav|and later experience has fully proved the advantage of a judicious system of gratuities for labor
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0119-000.wav|but
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0119-001.wav|mister pearson hardly considered the converse sufficiently
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0119-002.wav|and
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0120-000.wav|omitted the fact
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0120-001.wav|that he might have to deal with that persistent idleness
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0120-002.wav|which is not an unknown characteristic of the criminal class
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0121-000.wav|the hope of reward might do much
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0121-001.wav|but no system of penal discipline is complete
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0121-002.wav|unless it can also count upon
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0121-003.wav|the fear of punishment
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0122-000.wav|mister pearson seems to have taken for granted
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0122-001.wav|that all prisoners would behave well in his district
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0122-002.wav|prisons
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0123-000.wav|on that account
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0123-001.wav|he made no provision to insure safe custody
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0124-000.wav|thinking perhaps that prisoners so well disposed
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0124-001.wav|would cheerfully remain in jail of their own accord
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0125-000.wav|but
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0125-001.wav|an open farm of a thousand acres would have offered abundant chances of escape
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0125-002.wav|which some at least would have attempted
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0125-003.wav|probably with success
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0126-000.wav|the creation of an expensive staff for supervision
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0127-000.wav|or the still more costly process of walling in the whole farm
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0127-001.wav|would have greatly added to the charges of these establishments

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0129-000.wav|which marked the growth of public interest in prison affairs and which was the germ

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0130-000.wav|since admirably developed in the convict prisons of this country

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0132-001.wav|attention was again attracted to newgate

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0135-001.wav|or at worst but rarely
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0135-002.wav|and for short periods

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0193-000.wav|but as the plan was confessedly experimental for the benefit of the country generally the amount for which the city should be responsible

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0198-000.wav|and on a more mature consideration he realized that the limited area of the existing newgate site

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0205-004.wav|for the erection of a new jail
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0206-000.wav|this jail was nominally to replace the giltspur street compter

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0241-002.wav|salutary changes were successively introduced into the management of prisons

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0245-000.wav|the inquiry was most searching and complete and the committee spoke plainly in its report

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0250-000.wav|in many prisons the prisoners were still associated
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0250-001.wav|and from the want of a sufficient number of cells
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0250-002.wav|the principle of separation was still greatly neglected

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0251-001.wav|this principle as the committee pointed out
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0251-002.wav|must now be accepted

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0252-000.wav|while its rigid maintenance was in its opinion

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ019-0377-000.wav|and it is not strange if they did not very frequently hand up the offenders

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0047-003.wav|instead of increased
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0047-004.wav|during the winter months
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0048-000.wav|they are still declining
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0049-000.wav|the simple fact is that many million more people have private work to day
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0049-001.wav|than two years ago to day
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0049-002.wav|or one year ago to day
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0050-000.wav|and every day that passes offers more chances to work for those who want to work
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0051-000.wav|in spite of the fact that unemployment remains a serious problem
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0052-000.wav|here as in every other nation
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0052-001.wav|we have come to recognize the possibility
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0052-002.wav|and the necessity
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0052-003.wav|of certain
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0052-004.wav|helpful remedial measures
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0053-000.wav|these measures are of two kinds
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0054-000.wav|the forest is to make provisions intended to relieve
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0054-001.wav|to minimise
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0054-002.wav|and to prevent future on employment
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0055-000.wav|the second is to establish the practical means to help those who are unemployed in this present emergency
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0056-000.wav|our social security legislation
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0056-001.wav|is an attempt to answer the first of these questions
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0056-002.wav|our work's relief programme
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0056-003.wav|the second

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0057-001.wav|is a necessary part
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0057-002.wav|of the future unemployment policy of the government
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0058-000.wav|while our present and projected expenditures for work relief
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0058-001.wav|are wholly within the reasonable limits of our national credit resources
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0059-000.wav|it is obvious that we cannot continue to create governmental deficits for that purpose year after year
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0060-000.wav|we must begin now to make provision for the future
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0061-000.wav|that is why our social security programme
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0061-001.wav|is an important part
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0061-002.wav|of the complete picture
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0062-000.wav|it proposes by means of old age pensions
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0063-000.wav|to help those who have reached the age of retirement
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0063-001.wav|to give up their jobs
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0063-002.wav|and thus

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0064-000.wav|and to give to all a feeling of security as they looked toward old age
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0065-000.wav|the unemployment insurance part of the legislation
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0066-000.wav|will not only help to guard the individual in future periods of lay off against dependence upon relief

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0068-001.wav|is the incentive it will give to employers
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0068-002.wav|to plan more carefully
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0069-000.wav|in order that unemployment may be prevented

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ022-0074-000.wav|it is a problem quite as much for private industry as for the government

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ023-0020-000.wav|we then began a programme of remedying those abuses and inequalities

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ024-0079-001.wav|the welfare of the united states and indeed

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ024-0079-003.wav|is what we all must think about first
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ024-0080-000.wav|our difficulty with a court to day rises not from the court as an institution
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ024-0080-001.wav|but from human beings within it
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ024-0081-000.wav|but we cannot yield our constitutional destiny to the personal judgment
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ024-0081-001.wav|of a few men who
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ024-0081-002.wav|being fearful of the future
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ024-0082-000.wav|would deny us the necessary means of dealing with the present
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ024-0083-000.wav|this plan of mine is no attack on the court
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ024-0084-000.wav|it seeks to restore the court
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ024-0084-001.wav|to its rightful and historic place in our constitutional government
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ024-0085-000.wav|and to have it resume its high task
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ024-0085-001.wav|of building anew on the constitution

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ024-0087-000.wav|i have thus explained to you the reasons that lie behind our efforts
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ024-0087-001.wav|to secure results by legislation within the constitution
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ024-0088-000.wav|i hope that thereby the difficult process of constitutional amendment
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ024-0088-001.wav|may be rendered unnecessary
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ024-0088-002.wav|but
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ024-0089-000.wav|let us examine the process
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ024-0090-000.wav|there are many types of amendment proposed
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ024-0091-000.wav|each one is radically different from the other

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ024-0093-000.wav|it would take months or years to get substantial agreement upon the type and language of the amendment
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ024-0094-000.wav|it would take months and years thereafter
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ024-0094-001.wav|to get at two thirds majority in favor of that amendment
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ024-0094-002.wav|in both houses of the congress
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ024-0095-000.wav|then would come the long course of ratification by three fourths of all the states

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ024-0110-001.wav|is to suggest the time consuming process of amendment
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ024-0110-002.wav|in order to kill off by delay

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0023-002.wav|or reservoir of food

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0025-001.wav|and the most important distinction
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0025-002.wav|between animals and plants
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0026-000.wav|following out his teleological argument
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0026-001.wav|couvier remarks that the organization of this cavity
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0027-000.wav|and its appurtenances must needs vary according to the nature of the element
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0027-001.wav|and the operations which it has to undergo
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0028-000.wav|before it can be converted into substances fitted for absorption
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0029-000.wav|while the atmosphere and the earth
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0029-001.wav|supply plants with juices
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0029-002.wav|ready prepared
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0029-003.wav|and which can be absorbed immediately
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0030-000.wav|as the animal body required
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0030-001.wav|to be independent of heat
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0030-002.wav|and of the atmosphere
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0031-000.wav|there were no means by which the motion of its fluids could be produced by internal causes
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0032-000.wav|hence arose the second great distinctive character of animals
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0032-001.wav|or
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0032-002.wav|the circulatory system
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0032-003.wav|which is less important than the digestive
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0033-000.wav|since it was unnecessary
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0033-001.wav|and therefore is absent in the more simple animals
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0034-000.wav|animals further needed muscles for locomotion
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0034-001.wav|and nerves for sensibility
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0035-000.wav|hence says couvier
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0035-001.wav|it was necessary that the chemical composition of the animal body should be more complicated
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0035-002.wav|than that of the plant
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0036-000.wav|and it is so inasmuch as an additional substance nitrogen
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0036-001.wav|enters into it as an essential element
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0037-000.wav|while in plants
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0037-001.wav|nitrogen is only accidentally joined
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0037-002.wav|with the three other fundamental constituents of organic
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0037-003.wav|beings
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0038-000.wav|carbon

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0039-000.wav|he afterward affirms that
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0039-001.wav|nitrogen is peculiar to animals
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0039-002.wav|and herein he places the third distinction between the animal and the plant
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0040-000.wav|the soil and the atmosphere supply plants with water composed of hydrogen

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0042-002.wav|and absorbed little or no nitrogen

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0043-003.wav|which is effected through the agency of light

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ025-0044-001.wav|derive their nourishment either directly or indirectly from plants

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0314-001.wav|hastened down
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0314-002.wav|and setting one of the gates slightly ajar questioned him who he was and on what errand he had come

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0319-000.wav|and now he went on to say my coming to you babylonians

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0331-001.wav|his praise was in all mouths

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0332-002.wav|and then
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0332-003.wav|leading the troops to the place where the four thousand were
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ028-0333-000.wav|he put them also to the sword

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ034-0122-002.wav|that this suspect was lee harvey oswald
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ034-0123-000.wav|although brendan testified that the man in the window was standing when he fired the shots
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ034-0123-001.wav|most probably he was either sitting or kneeling

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ034-0124-001.wav|the arrangement of the boxes and the angle of the shots virtually preclude a standing position
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ034-0125-000.wav|it is understandable however for brendan to have believed that the man with the rifle was standing

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ034-0127-000.wav|brennan testified that they were standing
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ034-0127-001.wav|which is their apparent position in the photograph
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ034-0128-000.wav|but the testimony of these employees together with photographs subsequently taken of them at the scene of the assassination
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ034-0129-000.wav|establishes that they were either squatting or kneeling
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ034-0130-000.wav|since the window ledges in the depository building are lower than in most buildings

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ034-0131-001.wav|exposes more of his body than would normally be the case

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ034-0132-001.wav|this creates the impression that the person is standing
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ034-0133-000.wav|brandnan could have seen enough of the body of a kneeling or squatting person to estimate his height

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ034-0150-000.wav|but in his testimony before the commission brendan stated that his remarks of january seventh

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ037-0160-001.wav|this caused the bullets

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ037-0170-002.wav|he could not determine

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0024-000.wav|perhaps the most outstanding conclusion of such a study
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0024-001.wav|is that oswald was profoundly alienated from the world in which he lived

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0037-000.wav|his wife testified

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0038-000.wav|such ideas of grandeur were apparently accompanied

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0053-002.wav|and it probably influenced his decision to shoot a general walker

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0095-001.wav|which was apparently caused in part by marguerite's desire to get more money from him

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0107-001.wav|was not able to spend as much time with them
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0107-002.wav|as he would have liked
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0107-003.wav|because of the age gaps of five and seven years
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ040-0108-000.wav|which became more significant as the children grew older

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0090-003.wav|but a definite tendency there was in that direction i think

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0116-000.wav|after it was learned
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0116-001.wav|that he had defected to the soviet union
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0117-000.wav|in an attempt to have this discharge reversed

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0118-001.wav|to then secretary of the navy connolly
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0118-002.wav|on january thirty

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0119-000.wav|stating that he would quote
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0119-001.wav|employ all means to write this gross mistake or injustice and quote
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0120-000.wav|governor connolly had just resigned
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0120-001.wav|to run for governor of texas
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0120-002.wav|so he advised oswald
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0120-003.wav|that he had forwarded the letter
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0120-004.wav|to his successor
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0121-000.wav|it is thus clear
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0121-001.wav|that oswald knew that governor connolly
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0121-002.wav|was never directly concerned with his discharge
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0122-000.wav|and he must have known that president kennedy
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0122-001.wav|had had nothing to do with it
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0123-000.wav|in that connection
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0123-001.wav|it does not appear that oswald ever expressed any dissatisfaction of any kind
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0123-002.wav|with either the president
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0123-003.wav|or governor connolly
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0124-000.wav|marina oswald testified that she quote had never heard anything bad about kennedy from lee and he never had anything against him and quote
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0125-000.wav|missus oswald said
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0125-001.wav|that her husband did not say anything about governor connolly after his return to the united states

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0126-000.wav|but while we were in russia he spoke well of him
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0126-001.wav|least sir that when
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0126-002.wav|he would return to the united states
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0126-003.wav|he would vote for him for governor

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0127-000.wav|oswald must have already learned that the governor could not help him with his discharge
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0127-001.wav|because he was no longer secretary of the navy
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0127-002.wav|at the time he made that remark
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0128-000.wav|even though oswald apparently did not express any hostility against the president or governor connolly
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0129-000.wav|he continued to be concerned about his undesirable discharge
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0129-001.wav|it is clear that he thought he had been unjustly treated
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0130-000.wav|probably his complaint was due to the fact
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0130-001.wav|that his discharge was not related
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0130-002.wav|to anything he had done while unactive

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0131-000.wav|and also
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0131-001.wav|because he had not received any notice of the original discharge proceedings
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0131-002.wav|since his whereabouts were not known
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0132-000.wav|he continued his efforts to reverse the discharge
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0132-001.wav|by petitioning the navy discharged review board
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0133-000.wav|which finally declined to modify the discharge
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0133-001.wav|and so advised him in a letter dated july

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0134-000.wav|governor connolly's connection with the discharge although indirect
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0134-001.wav|caused the commission to consider whether he might have been oswald's real target

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0135-001.wav|it should be noted that
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0135-002.wav|marina oswald testified on september sixth nineteen sixty four

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0202-001.wav|to marxism contributed to the decisions
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ041-0202-002.wav|which led him to defect

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ042-0006-000.wav|he almost immediately left for the soviet union
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ042-0006-001.wav|where he attempted to renounce his citizenship

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ042-0007-001.wav|oswald thus committed an act which was the most striking indication he had yet given
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ042-0008-000.wav|of his willingness to act on his beliefs in quite extraordinary ways
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ042-0009-000.wav|while his defection resulted in part from oswald's commitment to markism
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ042-0010-000.wav|it appears that personal and psychological factors were also involved

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ042-0011-001.wav|oswald told mister william stuckey

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ042-0014-000.wav|was his service in japan
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ042-0015-000.wav|he said living conditions over there convinced him something was wrong with the system and that possibly marxism was the answer
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ042-0016-000.wav|he said it was in japan that he made up his mind to go to russia

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ042-0018-000.wav|on the other hand at least one person who knew oswald after his return thought that his defection had a more personal and psychological basis
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ042-0019-000.wav|the validity of the latter observation is borne out by some of the things oswald wrote in connection with his defection

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ042-0032-000.wav|and of his initial commitment to that country can best be understood however in the context

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0154-000.wav|after he thought that what he had written in his book might be proof against him

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0162-000.wav|marina oswald's testimony indicates that her husband was not particularly concerned about his continued possession of the most incriminating sort of evidence
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0163-000.wav|if he had been successful
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0163-001.wav|and had been apprehended even for routine questioning his apartment would undoubtedly have been searched
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0164-000.wav|and his role would have been made clear by the evidence which he had left behind
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0165-000.wav|leaving the note and picture as he did
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0165-001.wav|would seem to indicate
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0165-002.wav|that he had considered the possibility of capture
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0166-000.wav|possibly he might have wanted to be caught
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0166-001.wav|and wanted his involvement made clear
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0166-002.wav|if he was in fact apprehended
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0167-000.wav|even after his wife told him to destroy the note book
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0168-000.wav|he removed at least some of the pictures which had been pasted in it and saved them among his effects where they were found after the assassination

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0169-001.wav|with his wife's testimony that quote
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0170-000.wav|i asked him
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0170-001.wav|what for he was making all these entries in the book and he answered that he wanted to leave a complete record
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0170-002.wav|so that all the details would be in it
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0171-000.wav|i am guessing that perhaps he did it to appear to be a brave man in case he were arrested
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0171-001.wav|but that is my supposition
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0171-002.wav|and quote
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0172-000.wav|the attempt on general walker's life deserves close attention in any consideration of oswald's possible motive for the assassination
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0173-000.wav|and the trail of evidence he left behind him on that occasion
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0174-000.wav|while there are differences between the two events as far as oswald's actions and planning are concerned there are also similarities that should be considered
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0175-000.wav|the items which oswald left at home when he made his attack on walker
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0175-001.wav|suggest a strong concern for his place in history
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0176-000.wav|if the attack had succeeded and oswald had been caught

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0177-000.wav|and his communist and socialist workers parting newspapers would probably have appeared on the front pages of newspapers or magazines all over the country
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0178-000.wav|as in fact one of them did appear after the assassination
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0179-000.wav|the circumstances of the attack on walker
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0179-001.wav|coupled with other indications that oswald was concerned about his place in history
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0180-000.wav|and with the circumstances surrounding the assassination have led the commission to believe
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0181-000.wav|that such concern is an important factor to consider
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0181-001.wav|in assessing possible motivation for the assassination
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0182-000.wav|in any event
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0182-001.wav|the walker incident indicates
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0182-002.wav|that in spite of the belief among those who knew him
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0182-003.wav|that he was apparently not dangerous
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ043-0183-000.wav|oswald did not lack the determination and other traits required

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0203-002.wav|in his ideal of communism

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0205-000.wav|after he returned from his trip to mexico where his application to go to cuba had been sharply rejected

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0209-001.wav|because his wife did not want to live there with him

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0218-000.wav|thoughts of his personal difficulties must have been at least partly on his mind when he went to irving on thursday night
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0218-001.wav|and told his wife that he was lonely

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0222-000.wav|the feelings of hostility and aggression
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0222-001.wav|which seemed to have played such an important part in oswald's life

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0224-000.wav|and such a favorable opportunity to strike at a figure as great as the president would probably never have come to him again

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0225-001.wav|throws a little light on his motives
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0226-000.wav|the fact that he took so little money with him when he left irving in the morning
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0226-001.wav|indicates that he did not expect to get very far from dalis on his own
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ045-0227-000.wav|and suggests the possibility as did his note to his wife just prior to the attempt on general walker that he did not expect to escape at all

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0188-001.wav|to clarify the division of authority between the agencies involved and to retain the existing system

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0197-000.wav|it is also contended that the agents should be intimately associated with the life of the presidential family

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0201-000.wav|and becoming merely the recipient of information gathered by others would become limited solely to acts of physical alertness and personal courage

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ049-0208-002.wav|can be drawn

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ050-0166-000.wav|the commission was struck by the apparent lack of effort
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ050-0166-001.wav|on an inter agency basis
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ050-0167-000.wav|to develop co ordinated

/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ050-0167-003.wav|would not seem inconsistent
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ050-0168-000.wav|with the particular purposes of the agency involved
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ050-0168-001.wav|the commission recognizes that this is a controversial area
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ050-0169-000.wav|and that many strongly held views are advanced in resistance to any suggestion that an effort be made to impose any degree of co ordination
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ050-0170-000.wav|this matter is obviously beyond the jurisdiction of the commission
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ050-0171-000.wav|but it seems to warrant further study before each agency becomes irrevocably committed to separate action
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ050-0172-000.wav|the commission therefore recommends
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ050-0172-001.wav|that the president consider ordering an inquiry into the possibility
/mnt/home/chunksplit/ljspeech_deno_cycle1/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs_split_try1/LJ050-0173-000.wav|that co ordination might be achieved to a greater extent
