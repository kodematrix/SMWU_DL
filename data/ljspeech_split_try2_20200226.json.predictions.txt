printing in the only sense with which we are at present concerned
differs from most if not from all the arts and crafts represented in the exhibition
in being comparatively modern
for although the chinese took impressions from wood blocks
engraved in relief for centuries before the woodcutters of the netherlands
by a similar process
produced the block books which were the immediate predecessors of the true printed book
the invention of movable metal letters in the middle of the fifteenth century may justly be considered
as the invention of the art of printing
and it is worth mentioned in passing that as an example of fine typography
the earliest book printed with movable types the guttenbuerg or forty two line bible of about fourteen fifty five
has never been surpassed
printing then for our purpose may be considered as the art of making books by means of movable types
no
as all books not primarily intended as picture books consist principally of types composed to form letter press
it is of the first importance that the letter used should be fine in form
especially as no more time is occupied or cost incurred in casting
setting or printing beautiful letters
than in the same operations with ugly ones
and it was a matter of course that in the middle ages
when the craftsmen took care that beautiful form should always be a part of their productions whatever they were
the forms of printed letters should be beautiful
and that their arrangement on the page should be reasonable
and a help to the shapeliness of the letters themselves
the middle ages brought calygraphy to perfection and it was natural therefore
that the forms of printed letters should follow more or less closely those of the written character
and they followed them very closely
the first books were printed in black letter i e the letter which was a gothic development of the ancient roman character
and which developed more completely and satisfactorily on the side of the lower case than the capital letters
the lower case being in fact invented in the early middle ages
the earliest book printed with movable type the aforesaid guttenberg bible
is printed in letters which are in exact imitation
of the more formal ecclesiastical writing which obtained at that time
this has since been called missiletype
and was in fact the kind of letter used in the many splendid missiles psalters et cetera produced by printing in the fifteenth century
but the first bible actually dated
which also was printed at maints by peter chauffeur in the year fourteen sixty two
imitates a much freer hand simpler
rounder and less spiky
and therefore far pleasanter and easier to read
on the whole the type of this book may be considered
the neplu ultra
of the gothic type
especially as regards the lower case letters
and type very similar was used during the next fifteen or twenty years
not only by chauffeur
but by printers in strasburg
bazal
paris lubeck and other cities
but though on the whole
except in italy gothic letter was most often used
a very few years saw the birth of roman character not only in italy
but in germany and france
in fourteen sixty five
swayingheim and panarts began printing in the monastery of supiaco near rome
and used an exceedingly beautiful type
which is indeed to look at a transition between
gothic and roman
but which must certainly have come from the study of the twelfth or even the eleventh century m s s
they printed very few books in this type three only
but in their very first books in rome
beginning with the year fourteen sixty eight
they discarded this for a more completely roman
and far less beautiful letter
but about the same year mentalin at strasbourg began to print in a type which is distinctly roman
and the next year gunther zigner at augsburg followed suit
while in fourteen seventy at paris udoric gering and his associates turned out the first books printed in france
also in roman character
the roman type of all these printers is similar in character
and is very simple and legible and unaffectedly designed for use but it is by no means without beauty
it must be said
that it is in no way like the transition type of subiaco
and though more roman than that
yet scarcely more like the complete roman type of the earliest printers of rome
a further development of the roman letter
took place at venice
john of spiers and his brother windolen
followed by nicholas jenson
began to print in that city
fourteen sixty nine fourteen seventy
their type is on the lines of the german and french rather than of the roman printers
of jensen it must be said that he carried the development of roman type as far as it can go
his letter is admirably clear and regular but at least as beautiful as any other roman type
after his death in the fourteen eighties or at least by fourteen ninety
printing in venice had declined very much
and though the famous family of all this restored its technical excellence rejecting battered letters
and paying great attention to the press work or actual process of printing
yet their type is artistically on a much lower level than jenson's
and in fact
they must be considered to have ended the age of fine printing in italy
janson however had many contemporaries who used beautiful type
some of which as e g that of jacobus rubius or jacques la rouge is scarcely distinguishable from his
it was these great venetian printers together with their brethren of rome milan
parma and one or two other cities who produced the splendid editions of the classics which are one of the great glories of the printer's art
and are worthy representatives of the eager enthusiasm for the revived learning of that epoch
by far
the greater part of these italian printers it should be mentioned
or germans or frenchmen
working under the influence of italian opinion and aims
it must be understood that through the whole of the fifteenth and the first quarter of the sixteenth centuries
the roman letter was used side by side with the gothic
even in italy most of the theological and law books were printed in gothic letter
which was generally more formally gothic
than the printing of the german workman
many of whose types indeed like that of the subiaco works are of a transitional character
this was notably the case with the early works printed at home and in a somewhat lesser degree at augsburg
in fact gunther zigner's first type
afterwards used by schustler
is remarkably like the type of the before mentioned subiacuo books
in the low countries and cologne
which were very fertile of printed books
gothic was the favorite
the characteristic dutch type as represented by the excellent printer girad liee
is very pronounced and uncompromising gothic
this type was introduced into england
y winkin to word
caxton's successor
at was used there with very little variation
all through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and indeed into the eighteenth
most of caxton's own types are of an earlier character
though they also much resemble flemish or cologne letter
after the end of the fifteenth century
the degradation of printing especially in germany and italy
went on apace and by the end of the sixteenth century
there was no really beautiful printing dunb
the best mostly french or low country was neat and clear but without any distinction
the worst
which perhaps was the english
was a terrible falling off from the work of the earlier presses
and things got worse and worse through the whole of the seventeenth century
so that
in the eighteenth
printing was very miserably performed
in england about this time an attempt was made
notably by castlong who started business in london as a type founder in seventeen twenty
to improve the letter in form
castlon's type is clear and neat and fairly well designed
he seems to have taken the letter of the elzevirs of the seventeenth century for his model
type cast from his matresses is still in everyday use
in spite however of his praiseworthy efforts printing had still one last degradation to undergo
the seventeenth century founce were bad rather negatively than positively
but for the beauty of the earlier work they might have seemed tolerable
it was reserved for the founders of the later eighteenth century
to produce letters which are positively ugly
and which it may be added
are dazzling and unpleasant to the eye owing to the clumsy thickening and vulgar finning of the lines
for the seventeenth century letters are at least pure and simple in line
the italian
bordoni and the frenchman dido
were the leaders in this luckless change though our own baskerville who was at work some years before them went much on the same lines
but his letters though uninteresting and poor
are not nearly so gross and vulgar as those of either the italian or the frenchman
with this change
the art of printing touched bottom
so far as fine printing is concerned
though paper did not get to its worst till about eighteen forty
but chiswick press in eighteen forty four revived casslan's fholts
printing for messrs longman the diary of lady willoughby
this experiment was so far successful
that about eighteen fifty
messrs miller and richard of edinburgh
were induced to cut punches for a series of old style letters
these and similar founts cast by the above firm and others
have now come into general use and are obviously a great improvement on the ordinary modern style and use in england which is in fact the bodony type
a little reduced in ugliness
the design of the letters of this modern old style leaves a good deal to be desired
and the whole effect is a little too gray owing to the thinness of the letters
it must be remembered however that most modern printing is done by machinery on soft paper and not by the hand press
and these somewhat wiry letters are suitable for the machine process which would not do justice to letters of more generous design
it is discouraging to note that the improvement of the last fifty years is almost wholly confined to great britain
here and there a book is printed in france or germany with some pretension to good taste
but the general revival of the old forms has made no way in those countries
italy is contentedly stagnant
america has produced a good many showy books the typography paper and illustrations of which are however all wrong
oddity rather than rational beauty and meaning being apparently the thing sought for both in the letters and the illustrations
to say a few words on the principles of design and typography
it is obvious that legibility is the first thing to be aimed at in the forms of the letters
this is best furthered by the avoidance of irrational swellings and spiky projections and by the using of careful purity of line
even the caslon type when enlarged shows great shortcomings in this respect
the ends of many of the letters such as the tea and e are hucked up in a vulgar and meaningless way
instead of ending in the sharp and clear stroke of jenson's letters
there is a grossness in the upper finishings of letters like the sea the a and so on
an ugly pear shaped swelling defacing the form of the letter
in short it happens to this craft as to others that the utilitarian practice though it professes to avoid ornament
still clings to a foolish because misunderstood conventionality deduced from what was once ornament and is by no means useful
which title can only be claimed by artistic practice whether the art in it be conscious or unconscious
in no characters is the contrast between the ugly and vulgar illegibility of the modern type
and the elegance and legibility of the ancient
more striking than in the arabic numerals
in the old print each figure has its definite individuality and one cannot be mistaken for the other
in reading the modern figures the eyes must be strained before the reader can have any reasonable assurance
that he has a five and eight or a three before him unless the press work is of the best
this is awkward if you have to read bradshaws died in a hurry
one of the differences between the fine type and the utilitarian must probably be put down to a misapprehension of a commercial necessity
this is the narrowing of the modern letters
most of jenson's letters are designed within a square
the modern letters are narrowed by a third or thereabout
but while this gain of space very much hampers the possibility of beauty of design
it is not a real gain for the modern printer throws the gane away by putting inordinately wide spaces between his lines which probably
the lateral compression of his letters renders necessary
commercialism again compels the use of type too small in size to be comfortable reading
the size known as long primer
ought to be the smallest size used in a book meant to be read
here again if the practice of leading
were retrenched
larger type could be used without enhancing the price of a book
one very important matter in setting up for fine printing is this spacing that is the lateral distance of words from one another
in good printing the spaces betweenh words should be as near as possible equal
it is impossible that they should be quite equal except in lines of poetry
modern printers understand this but it is only practised in the very best establishments
but another point which they should attend to
they almost always disregard
this is the tendency to the formation of ugly meandering white lines or rivers in the page
a blemish which can be nearly though not wholly avoided by care and forethought
the desirable thing being the breaking of the line as in bonding masonry or brick work
the general solidity of a page is much to be sought for
modern printers generally overdo the whites in the spacing
a defect probably forced on them by the characterless quality of the letters
for where these are boldly and carefully designed
and each letter is thoroughly individual in form
the words may be sait much closer together
without loss of clearness
no definite rules however
except the avoidance of rivers
and excess of white can be given for the spacing
which requires the constant exercise of judgment and taste on the part of the printer
the position of the page on the paper
should be considered if the book is to have a satisfactory look
here once more
the almost invariable modern practice is in opposition
to a natural sense of proportion
from the time when books first
took their present shape till the end of the sixteenth century
or indeed later
the page soul lay on the paper
that there was more space allowed to the bottom
and for margin
then to the top and back of the paper
the unit of the book being looked on as the two pages forming an opening
the modern printer
in the teeth of the evidence given by his own eyes
considers the single page as the unit
and prints the page in the middle of his paper
only nominally so
however in many cases
since when he uses a headline
he counts that in
the result is measured by the eye
being that the lower margin is less than the top one
and that the whole opening has an upside down look vertically
and that latterly
the page looks as if it were being driven off the paper
the paper on which the printing is to be done
is a necessary part of our subject
of this it may be said
that though there is some good paper made now
it is never used except for very expensive books
although
it would not materially increase the cost in all but the very cheapest
the paper that is used for ordinary books is exceedingly bad
even in this country
buh
is beaten in the race for vileness
by that made in america
which is the worst conceivable
there seems to be no reason why ordinary paper should not be better made
even allowing the necessity for a very low price
but
any improvement must be based on showing openly
that the cheap article is cheap
e g the cheap paper should not sacrifice toughness and durability
to a smooth and white surface
which should be indications of a delicacy of material
and manufacture
which would of necessity increase its cost
one fruitful source of badness in paper
is the habit that publishers have of eking out a thin volume
by printing it on thick paper
almost of the substance of cardboard
a device which deceives nobody
and makes a book very unpleasant to read
on the hay a small dick
should be printed on paper which is as thin as may be
without being transparent
the paper used for printing the small
highly ornamented french service books
about the beginning of the sixteenth century
is a model in this respect
being thin
tough and opaque
however
the fact must not be blinked
that machine made paper cannot in the nature of things be made of so good a texture
as that made by hand
the ornamentation of printed books is too wide a subject to be dealt with fully here
but one thing must be said on it
the essential point to be remembered
is that the ornament
whatever it is
whether picture or pattern work
should form part of the page
should be a part of the whole scheme of the book
simple as this proposition is
it is necessary to be stated
because the modern practice is to disregard the relation between the printing and the ornament altogether
so that if the two are helpful to one another
it is a mere matter of accident
the due relation of letter to pictures and other ornament
was thoroughly understood by the old printers
so that
even when the wood cuts are very rude indeed
the proportions of the page
still give pleasure
by the sense of richness that the cuts and letter together convey
when
as is most often the case
there is actual beauty in the cods
the books so ornamented
are amongst the most delightful works of art
that have ever been produced
therefore
granted well designed type
due spacing of the lines and words
and proper position of the page on the paper
all books might be at least comely and well looking
and if to these good qualities were added really beautiful ornament and pictures
printed books might once again illustrate to the full
the position of our society
that a work of utility
might be also a work of art
if we cared to make it so
the chronicles of newgate volume two by arthur griffiths section four newgate down to eighteen eighteen
under the conditions referred to in the previous chapter
with criminals and misdemeanouns of all shades crowding perpetually into its narrow limits the latter state of newgate was worse than the first
the new jail fell as far short of the demands made on it as did the old
the prison population fluctuated a great deal
but it was almost always in excess of the accommodation available and there were times when the place was full to overflowing
neeled gives some figures which well illustrate this
on the fourteenth june eighteen hundred there were one hundred ninety nine debtors and two hundred eighty nine felons in the prison
on the twenty seventh april in the following year
these numbers had risen to two hundred seventy five and three hundred seventy five respectively or six hundred fifty in all
for two more years these high figures were steadily maintained and in eighteen o three the total rose to seven hundred ten
after that they fell as steadily
till eighteen o eight the lowest point was touched of one hundred ninety seven debtors and one hundred eighty two felons or three hundred seventy nine in all
the numbers soon increased however and by eighteen eleven had again risen to six hundred twenty nine and mister neelde was told that there had been at one time
three hundred debtors and nine hundred criminals in newgate were twelve hundred prisoners in all
previous to that date there had been seven hundred or eight hundred frequently and once in mister eckerman's time one thousand
trustworthy evidence is forthcoming to the effect that these high figures were constantly maintained for many months at a time
the inadequacy of the jail was noticed and reported upon again and again by the grand juries of the city of london
who seldom let a session go by without visiting newgate
in eighteen thirteen
the grand jury made a special presentment to the court of common council pointing out that on the debtor side which was intended for only one hundred
no less than three hundred forty were crowded to the great inconvenience and danger of the inmates
on the female side matters were much worse
but the apartments set apart for them being built to accommodate sixty persons now contain about one hundred twenty and qute
returns laid before the house of commons showed that six thousand four hundred thirty nine persons had been committed to newgate
in the three years between eighteen thirteen and eighteen sixteen
and this number did not include the debtors a numerous class who were still committed to newgate pending the completion of the white cross street prison
in order to realize the evils entailed by incarceration in newgate in these days it is necessary to give some account of its interior
as it was occupied and appropriated in eighteen ten
full details of the arrangements are to be found in mister neele's state of prisons in england scotland and wales published in eighteen twelve
the jail at that date was divided into eight separate and more or less distinct departments each of which had its own wards and yard
these were one the male debtors sighed
two the female det her side three the chapel yard four the middle yard
five the master felon's side six the female felon's side seven the state side
eight the press yard
one the male at her side consisted of a yard forty nine feet by thirty one
leading to thirteen wards on various floors and a day room
of these wards three were appropriated to the cabin side so called because
they each contained four small rooms or cabins seven feet square
intended to accommodate a couple of prisoners a peace but often much more crowded
two other wards were appropriated to the master's side debtors they were each twenty three feet by fourteen and a half
and supposed to accommodate twenty persons the eight remaining wards were for the common side debtors
long narrow rooms one thirty six feet six twenty three feet and the eighth eighteen
the whole about fifteen feet wide
the various wards were all about eleven feet in height
and were occupied as a rule by ten to fifteen people when the prison was not crowded but double the number was occasionally placed in them
the day room was fitted with benches and settles after the manner of the tap in a public house
two the female debther side consisted of a courtyard forty nine by sixteen feet
leading to two wards one of which was thirty six feet by fifteen
and the other eighteen by fifteen and they nominally held twenty two persons
a high wall fifteen feet in height divided the females courtyard from the men's
three the chapel yard was about forty three feet by twenty five
it had been for some time devoted principally to felins of the worst types
those who were the oldest offenders sentenced to transportation and who had narrowly escaped the penalty of death
this arrangement was however modified after eighteen eleven and the chapel yard was allotted to misdemeanours and prisoner's awaiting trial
the wards in this part were five in number all in dimensions twenty feet by fifteen with the sixth ward fifteen feet square
these wards were all fitted with barrack beds but no bedding was supplied
the chapel yard led to the chapel and on the staircase were two rooms frequently set apart for the king's witnesses
those who had turned kings evidence whose safety might have been imperilled had they been lodged with the men against whom they had informed
but these king's witnesses were also put at times into the press yard among the capital convicts seemingly a very dangerous proceeding
or they lodged with the gatesman the prisoner officers who had charge of the inner gates
the middle yard was at first given up to the least heinous offenders after eighteen twelve it changed functions with the chapel yard
it was fifty feet by twenty five and had five wards each thirty eight by fifteen at one end of the yard was an arcade
directly under the chapel in which there were three cells used either for the confinement of disorderly and refractory prisoners
or female convicts ordered for execution
the master fell inside consisted of a yard the same size as the preceding appropriated nominally to the most decent and better behaved prisoners
but really kept for the few who had funds sufficient to gain them admission to these more comfortable quarters
here were also lodged the gatesmen the prisoners who had charge of the inner gates and who were entrusted with the duty of escorting visitors from the gates
to the various wards their friends occupied
the state side was the part stolen from the female felon side
it was large and comparatively commodious being maintained on a better footing than any other part of the prison
the inmates were privileged either by antecedents or the fortunate possession of sufficient funds to pay the charges of the place
neeled takes it for granted that the former rather than the latter prevailed in the selection
and tells us that in the state side quote such prisoners were safely associated whose manners and conduct evince a more liberal style of education
and who are therefore lodged apart from all other districts of the jail and quit
the state side contained twelve good sized rooms
from twenty one by eighteen feet to fifteen feet square which were furnished with bedsteads and bedding
seven the press yard was that part set aside for the condemned
its name and its situation were the same as those of the old place of carrying out the terrible sentence inflicted unaccused persons who stood mute
the long narrow yard still remained as we saw it in jacobite times
and beyond it was now a day room for the capital convicts or those awaiting execution
beyond the press yard were three stories condemned cells fifteen in all with vaulted ceilings nine feet high to the crown of the arch
the ground floor cells were nine feet by six
those on the first floor were rather larger on account of a set off in the wall and the uppermost were the largest for the same reason
security was provided for in these condemned cells by lining the substantial stone walls with planks studded with broad headed nails
they were lighted by a double grated window two feet nine inches by fourteen inches and in the doors which were four inches thick
a circular aperture had been let in to give ventilation and secure a free current of air
in each cell there was a barrack bedstead on the floor without bedding
eight the female felons were deprived of part of the space which the architect had intended for them
more than half theire quadrangle had been partitioned off for another purpose
and what remained was divided into a master's and a common side for female felons
the two yards were adjoining that for the common side much the largest
there were nine wards in all on the female side one of them in the attic
with four casements and two fireplaces being allotted for a female infirmary
and the rest being provided with barrack beds and in dimensions varying from thirty feet by fifteen two fifteen feet by ten
the eight courts above enumerated were well supplied with water
they had dust bins sewers and so forth properly disposed and the city scavenger paid periodical visits to the prison
the prisoners had few comforts beyond the occasional use of a bath at some distance situated in the press yard
to which access was granted rarely and as a great favour but they were allowed the luxury of drink if they could pay for it
a recent reform had closed the tap kept by the jailer within the precincts but
there was still a convenient room which served and quote
near it a grating through which the debtors receive their beer from the neighboring public houses
the felon's side has a similar accommodation and this mode of introducing the beverage is adopted because no publicin as such
can be permitted to enter the interior of this prison and quote the tap room and bar were just behind the felon's entrance lodge
and beyond it was a room called the wine room because formerly used for the sale of wine but
in which latterly a copper had been fixed for the cooking of provisions sent in by charitable persons
quote on the top of the jail continues neeld are a watchhouse and a sentry box where two or more guards with dogs and firearms
watch all night adjoining the felon side lodge is the keeper's office where the prison books are kept and his clerk
called the clerk of the papers attend daily and quote
having thus briefly described the plan and appropriation of prison i propose to deal now with the general condition of the inmates and the manner of their life
of these the debtors male and female formed a large proportion
the frequency and extent of processes against debtors seventy or eighty years ago will appear almost incredible
in an age when insolvent acts and bankruptcy court do so much to relieve the impecunious
and imprisonment for debt has almost entirely disappeared
the number of processes against debtors annually was extraordinary
neeled gibbs on the authority of mister burchell the under sheriff of middlesex
a table showing the figures for the year ending michaelmas eighteen o two
in that period upwards of two hundred thousand writs
had been issued for the arrests of debtors in the kingdom for sums varying from fourpence to five hundred pounds and upwards
fifteen thousand of these were issued in middlesex alone which at that time was reckoned as only a fifteenth of great britain
the number of arrests actually made was one hundred fourteen thousand three hundred for the kingdom and seven thousand twenty for middlesex
beaerly half of these gave bell bonds on arrest and the remainder went to prison
quite half of the foregoing writs and arrests supplied to sums under thirty pounds
neild also says that in seventeen ninety three
five thousand seven hundred nineteen rits and executions for debts between ten pounds and twenty pounds were issued in middlesex
and the aggregate amount of debts sued for was eighty one thousand seven hundred ninety one pounds
he also makes the curious calculation that the costs of these actions if undefended
would have amounted to sixty eight thousand seven hundred twenty eight pounds and if defended
two hundred eighty five thousand nine hundred fifty pounds in other words that to recover eighty odd thousand pounds
three times the amount would be expended
and elaborate machinery planned for the protection of the trader and altogether on his side had long existed for the recovery of debts
alfred the great established the court baron the hundred court and the county court which among other matters entertain please for debt
the county court was the sheriffs who sat there surrounded by the bishop and the magnates of the county
but as time passed difficulties and delays in obtaining judgment led to the removal of causes to the great court of king's bench
and the disuse of the inferior courtse
so much inconvenience ensued that in fifteen eighteen the corporation obtained from parliament and act empowering two aldermen
and four common councilmen to hold courts of requests or courts of conscience to hear and determine all causes of debt
under forty shillings arising within the city
these courts were extended two centuries later to several large provincial towns and all were in full activity when kneeled wrote
and indeed supplied the bulk of the poor debtors committed to prison
these courts were open to many and grave objections
the commissioners who presided were quote little otherwise than self elected
and when once appointed continued to serve sene die they were generally near in rank to the parties whose causes they decided
often a commissioner had to leave the bench because he was himself a party to the suit that was subdudi say
the activity as well as the futility of these courts may be estimated from the statement given by neeled
that thirteen hundred and twelve debtors were committed by them to newgate between seventeen ninety seven and eighteen o eight
and that no more than one hundred ninety seven creditors recovered debts and costs
the latter indeed hung like millstones round the neck of the unhappy insolvent wretches who found themselves in limbo
costs were the gallons of sack to the pennyworth of debt
neeled found at his visit to newgate in eighteen ten
fourteen men and women who had lain there ten eleven and thirteen years for debts of a few shillings
weighted by treble the amount of costs
thus amongst others thomas blackburn had been committed on october fifteenth for a debt of one shilling fivepence
for which the costs were six shillings tenpence
thomas dobson on twenty second august seventeen ninety nine for one shilling with costs of eight shillings tenpence
and susanna evans in october the same year for two shillings with costs of six shillings eightpence
other cases are recorded elsewhere as at the gildsbur street compter where in eighteen o five mister neele found a man named william grant
detained for one shilling ninepence with costs of five shillings
and john lancaster for one shilling eightpence with costs of seven shillings sixpence quote
these surely i thought says mister needle we're bad enough but it was not so and quoe
he recites another most outrageous and extraordinary case in which one john bird
a market porter was arrested and committed at the suit of a publican
for the paltry sum of fourpence with costs of seven shillings sixpence
bird was however discharged within three days by a subscription raised among his fellow prisoners
mister buxton and his inquiry into the system of prison discipline
quotes a case which came within his own knowledge of a boy sent to prison for non payment of one penny
the lad in question was found in cold bathfield's prison to which he had been sent for a month in default of paying a fine of forty shillings
he had been in the employ of a corn chanbler at islington and went into london with his master's cart and horse
there was in e city road a temporary bar with a collector of tolls who was sometimes on the spot and sometimes not
the boy declared he saw no one and accordingly passed through without paying the toll of a penny
for this he was summoned before a magistrate and sentenced as already stated
the lad was proved to be of good character and the son of respectable parents
mister buxton's friends at once paid the forty shillings and the boy was released
the costs in heavier debts always double the sum if the arrest was made in the country it trebled it
neield gives a list of the various items charged upon a debt of ten pounds which included instructions to sue
affidavit of debt a drawing precipe one pound five shillings capias fee to officeer on arrest
affidavit of service and many more amounting in all to twenty seven
and costing eleven pounds fifteen shillings eightpence within ten days
before dealing with the debtors in newgate i may refer incidentally
to those in other london prisons for newgate was not the only place of durance for these unfortunate people there were also the king's bench
the fleet and the marshal sea prisons especially devoted to them
whilst ludgate the gildsbur street and borrogh compters also received them
the latter too being also a prison for felons and vagrants arrested within certain limits
the king's bench was a national prison in which were confined all debtors arrested for debt or for contempt of the court of the king's bench
the population generally amounted to from five hundred to seven hundred the accommodation being calculated for two hundred
every newcomer was entitled to a chummage ticket but did not always get it
being often obliged to pay a high rent for a bed at the coffee house or in some room which was vacated by its regular occupant
no fixed rates or rules governed the hiring out of rooms or parts of a room and all sorts of imposition was practised
the best or at least the most influential prisoners god lodging in the state house which contained eight large handsome rooms
besides those actually resident within the walls
another two hundred more or less took advantage of the rules and lived outside within a circumference of two miles and a half
in these cases security was given for the amount of the debt
and a heavy fee at the rate of eight pounds per one hundred pounds with four pounds for every additional hundred
besides these a number had the privilege of a run on the quey which allowed a prisoner to go into the rules for the day
the foregoing rentals and payments for privileges together with fees exacted on commitment and discharge went to the marshal or keeper of the prison
whose net annual income thus entirely derived from the impecunious amounted to between three and four thousand pounds
the office of marshall had been hereditary
but in the twenty seventh george the second the right of presentation was bought by the crown for ten thousand five hundred pounds
the marshal was supposed to be resident either within the prison or the rules
he seems to have felt no responsibility as to the welfare or comfort of those in charge and out of whom he made all his money
the prison was always in the most filthy state imaginable
the half or holy starved prisoners fished for alms or food at the gratings
when they were sick no more notice was taken of them that of a dog
a man dying of liver complaint lay on the cold stones without a bed or food to eat
dissolute habits prevailed on all sides drunkenness was universal gambling perpetual
the yards were taken up with rackets and five quarts and here and there were bumble puppy grounds a game in which the players rolled iron bowls
into holes marked with numbers
how to make most profit out of the wretched denizens of the jail was the marshal's only care he got a rent for the coffee house and the bakehouse
the keeper of the large tap room called the brace because it was once kept by two brothers named partridge also paid him toll
the sale of spirits was forbidden but jin could always be had at the whistling shops where it was known as moonshine sky blue
mexico and was consumed at the rate of a hogshead per week
the fleet which stood in farrington street
was a prison for debtors and persons committed for contempt by the courts of chancery exchequer and common please
it was so used for the date of the abolition of the star chamber in the sixteenth charles the first
the shameful malpractices of bambridge
the warden of the fleet at the commencement of the eighteenth century are too well known to need more than a passing reference
a committee of the house of commons investigated the charges against bambrage who was proved to have connived at the escape of some debtors
and to have been guilty of extortion to others one sir william rich baronet he had loaded with heavy irons
in consequence of these disclosures both bambridge and hoggin his predecessor in the office were committed to newgate
and many reforms instituted but the condition of the prison and its inmates remained unsatisfactory to the last
it contained generally from six to seven hundred inmates while another hundred more or less resided in the rules outside
the principle of chummage prevailed as in the king's bench
but a number of rooms fifteen more or less were reserved for poor debtors under the name of bartholemyo fair
the rentals of rooms and fees went to the warden whose income was two thousand three hundred seventy two pounds
the same evils of overcrowding uncleanliness want of medical attendance
absence or neglect of divine service were present as in the king's bench but in an exaggerated form
the committee on jails reported that quote although the house of the warden looked into the court
and the turnkeys slept in the prison yet scenes of riot drunkenness and disorder were most prevalent and quote
the state of morals was disgraceful any woman obtained admission if sober and if she got drunk she was not turned out
there was no distinct place for the female debtors who lived in the same galleries as the men
disturbances were frequent owing to the riotous conduct of intoxicated women
twice a week there was a wine and beer club held at night which lasted till two or three in the morning
in the yard behind the prison
were places set apart for skittles fibes and tennis which strangers frequented as any other place of public amusement
matters were rather better at the marshal sea
this very ancient prison which stood in a high street southwark
was used for debtors arrested for the lowest sums within twelve miles of the palace of whitehall
also for prisoners committed by the admiralty court
at one time the marshal sea was the receptacle of pirates but none more committed to it after seventeen eighty nine
the court of the marshal sea was instituted by charles the first in the sixth year of his reign
to be held before the steward of the royal household the night marshal and the steward of the court
with jurisdiction to hold please in all actions within the prescribed limits the court was chiefly used for the recovery of small debts under ten pounds
but its business was much reduced by the extension of the courts of conscience
the prison was a nest of abuses like its neighbor the king's bench
and came under the strong animate version of the jail committee of seventeen twenty nine
as the business of the martial sea court declined the numbers in its prison diminished
the population as reported by the committee in eighteen fourteen averaged about sixty
and the prison although wives and children resided within the walls was not overcrowded
their conduct too was orderly on the whole
drunkenness was not common chiefly because liquor was not to be had freely although the tapster paid a rent of two guineas a week for permission to sell it
the inmates who euphemistically styled themselves collegians
were governed by rules which they themselves had framed and under which subscriptions were levied
and finds imposed for conduct disapproved of by the college
a court of the collegians was held every monday to manage its affairs at which all prisoners were required to attend
a committee of collegians was elected to act as the executive also a secretary or accounted to receive moneys and keep books
and a master of the ale room who kept this the sceen of their revels clean and saw that boiling water was provided for grug
bad language quarrelling throwing water over one another was forbidden on pain of fine and being sent to coventry
but the prevailing moral tone may be guessed from the penalty inflicted upon persons singing obscene songs before nine p m
yet the public opinion of the whole body seems to have checked dissipation
the poorer prisoners were not in abject want as in other prisons
owing to many charitable gifts and bequests which included annual donations from the archbishop of canterbury
the lord steward of the household the steward and officers of the martial sea court and others
legacies had also been left to free a certain number of debtors notably that of one hundred pounds per annum
left by a mister henry alnut who was long a prisoner in the marshal sea and came into a fortune while there
his bequest which was charged upon his manner at goring oxen and hence called the oxford charity
was applied only to the release of poor debtors whom four pounds each could free
the supreme control of the marshal sea was vested in the marshal of the royal household but although he drew a salary of five hundred pounds a year
he did nothing beyond visiting the prison occasionally and left the administration to the deputy marshal
the latter's salary with fees the rent of the tap and of the chandler's shop amounted to about six hundred pounds a year
the compters of ludgate gildsburg street and the borough were discontinued as debtors prisons as was newgate also
on the opening of white cross prison for debtors in eighteen fifteen
ludgate to the last was the debtor's prison for freemen of the city of london
clergymen proctors attorneys and persons specially selected by the corporation
at one time the ludgate debtors accompanied by the keeper
went outside and beyond the prison to call on their creditors and try to arrange their debts but this practice was discontinued
there were fifteen rooms of various sizes and as the numbers imprisoned rarely exceeded five and twenty the place was never overcrowded
while the funds of several bequests and charities were applied in adding to the material comfort of the prisoners
the giltsbur street compter received sheriff's debtors also felons vagrants and night charges
it was generally crowded as debtors who would have gone to the poultry compter were sent to gildsbur street when the former was condemned as unfit to receive prisoners
the demands for fees were excessive in gildsbur street
those who could not pay were thrown into the wards with the night charges
and denied admission to the charity wards which partook of all the benefits of bequests and donations to poor debtors
the borough compter was in a disgraceful state to the last the men's ward had an earth or rather a mud floor
and was so unfit to sleep on that it had not been used for many years so that the men and women associated together indiscriminately
the rooms had no fireplaces so it mattered little that no coals were allowed
there were no beds or bedding no straw even
in one room mister nielde found a woman ill of a flux shut up with three men
the latter raised eighteenpence among them to pay for a truss of straw for the poor woman to lie on
neeled found the prisoners in the borough compter ragged starving and dirty
i come now to the debtors in newgate the quarters they occupied were divided as i have said into three principal divisions
the master's side the cabin sighed and the common side payment of a fee of three shillings gained the debtor admission to the two first named
those who could pay nothing went as a matter of course to the common side
a further fee was however
demanded from the newcomer before he was made free of either the masters or the cabin side
this was the reprehensible claim for garnish which had already been abolished in all well conducted prisons but which still was demanded in newgate
garnish on the cabin side was a guinea
at entrance for coals
candles brooms et cetera and a gallon of beer on discharge
on the master's side
it was thirteen and fourpence and a gallon of beer on entrance although mister newman
in his evidence in eighteen fourteen said it was more
and gave the garnish for the common side at that sum
which is five shillings more than mister neele says was extorted on the common side
numerous tyrannies were practised on all who would not and could not pay the garnish
they were made to wash and swab the ward
or they were shut out from the ward fireplace and forbidden to pass a chalked line drawn on the floor
and so were unable either to warm themselves or to cook their food
besides these spees legitimate and illegitimate
there were others which must be paid before release
the sheriff demanded four shillings sixpence for his liberate
the jailer six shillings tenpence more
and the turnkey two shillings
and thus when the debtor's debt had been actually paid or when he had abandoned his property to the creditors and almost destitute
looked forward to his liberty
he was still delayed until he had paid a new debt arising quote
only out of the satisfaction of all his former deaths and quote the fees were not always extorted it is true
nor was non payment made a pretext for further imprisonment thanks to the humanity of the jailer or the funds provided by various charities
there was this much honest forbearance in newgate in these days
that debtors who could afford the cabin and master's side were not permitted to share in the prison charities
these were lumped together into a general fund
and a calculation made as to the amount that might be expended per week from the whole sum so that the latter might last out the year
it generally ran to about six pounds per week
the money which at one time had been distributed quarterly and all went in drink
was after eighteen o seven
through the exertions of the keeper of the jail
spent in the purchase of necessaries
but this weekly pittance did not go far when the debtor's side was crowded as it often was
notably as when numbers filled newgate
in anticipation of lord redsdale's build for insolvent debtors
and there were as many as three hundred and fifty prisoners in at one time
the city also allowed the poor debtors
fourteen ounces of bread daily
and their share of eight stone of meat
an allowance which never varied
he issued once a week
and divided as far as it would go
a very precarious and uncertain ration
the bread was issued every alternate day
and while some prisoners often ate their whole allowance at once
others who arrived just after the time of distribution
were often forty eight hours without food
the latter might also be six days without meat
share in the weekly allowance of meat might also be denied to debtors who had not paid garnish as well as in the weekly grant from the charitable fund
hence starvation stared many in the face unless friends from outside came to their assistance
or the keeper made them a special grant of sixpence per dim
out of the common stock
or the sixpenny allowance was claimed for the creditors which seldom happened owing to the expense
the process entailed
the poor debtors were not supplied with beds
those who could pay the price might hire them from each other
or from persons who made a trade of it or they might bring their beds with them into the prison
failing any of these methods seeing that straw was forbidden for fear of fire they had to be satisfied with a couple of the rugs provided by the city
the supply of which was however limited
and there were not always enough to give bedding to all
the stock was diminished by theft
female visitors carried them out of the prisons
or the debtors destroyed them when the weather was warm
and they were not in great demand in order to convert them into mop heads or cleaning rags
sometimes rugs were urgently required and not forthcoming
a severe winter set in
the new stock had not been supplied by the contractors and the poor debtors perished of cold
again
there was no regular allowance of fuel
coals were purchased out of the garnish money
and the charitable fund
so were candles salt pepper mops and brooms but the latter could have been of little service dirt prevailed everywhere
indeed the place with its oak floors cocked with pitch and smoked ceilings
could not be made even to look clean while there was no obligation of personal cleanliness on individuals who often came into the prison in filthy rags
only now and again in extreme cases an unusually nasty companion was stripped
hailed to the pump
the chronicles of newgate volume two by arthur griffith's section five newgate down to eighteen eighteen part two
the squalor and uncleanness of the debtor side was intensified by constant overcrowding
prisoners were committed to it quite without reference to its capacity
no remonstrance was attended to
no steps taken to reduce the number of committals and the governor was obliged to utilize the chapel as a day and night room
besides this although the families of debtors were no longer permitted to live with them inside the jail
hundreds of women and children came in every morning to spend the day there and there was no limitation whatever to the numbers of visitors admitted to the debtor's side
friends arrived about nine a m and went out at nine p m when as many as two hundred visitors have been observed leaving the debtors yards at one time
the day passed in revelry and drunkenness although spirituous liquors were forbidden
wine and beer might be had in any quantity the only limitation being
that not more than one bottle of wine or one quart of beer could be issued at one time no account was taken of the amount of liquors admitted in one day
and debtors might practically have as much as they liked if they could only pay for it
no attempt was made to check drunkenness beyond the penalty of shutting out friends from any ward in which a prisoner exceeded
quarrelling among the debtors was not unfrequent blows were struck and fights often ensued
for this and other acts of misconduct there was the discipline of the refractory ward or strong room on the debtor's side
bad cases were removed to a cell on the felon side and here they were locked in solitary confinement for three days at a time
order throughout the debtor side was preserved
and discipline maintained by a system open to grave abuses and which had the prescription of long usage
and which was never wholly rooted out for many years to come
this was the pernicious plan of governing by prisoners or of setting a favorite view in authority over the many
the head of the debtor's prison was a prisoner called the steward who was chosen by the whole body from six whom the keeper nominated
this steward was practically supreme
all the allowances of food passed through his hands
he had the control of the poor box perchance charities
he collected the garnish money and distributed the weekly grant from the prison charitable fund
in the latter duties he was however supervised by three auditors freely chosen by the prisoners among themselves
the auditors were paid a shilling each for their services each time the poor box was opened the steward was also remunerated for his trouble
he had a double allowance of bread deducted of course from the already too limited portion of the rest
and no doubt made the meat also pay toll
under the steward there were captains of wards chosen in the same way and performing analogous duties
these subordinate chiefs were also rewarded out of the scanty prison rations
the same system was extended to the criminal side and cases were on record of the place of wardsmen being sold for considerable sums
so valuable were they deemed that as much as fifty guineas was offered to the keeper for the post
enough has been said probably to prove that there was room for improvement in the condition and treatment of debtors in the prisons of the city of london
this gradually was forced upon the consciousness of the corporation
and about eighteen twelve application was made to parliament for funds to build a new debtor's prison
authority was given to raise money on the orphans fund to the extent of ninety thousand pounds
a sight was purchased between red lion and white cross street and a new prison plan
which would accommodate the inmates of newgate and of the three comptors ludgate
gildsbur street and the poultry or about four hundred and seventy six in all
the evils of association for these debtors were perpetuated although the plan provided for the separation of the various contingents committed to it
there was no lack of air and light for the new jail and several exercising yards
the completion of this very necessary building was however much delayed for want of funds
and it was not ready to relieve newgate till late in eighteen fifteen
the reforms which were to be attempted in that prison
more particularly as regarded the classification of prisoners and which were dependent on the space to be gained by the removal of the debtors
could not be carried out till then it is to be feared that long after the opening of white cross street prison
newgate continued to be a reproach to those responsible for its management
i pass now to the criminal side of newgate which consisted of the six quarters or yards already enumerated and described
the inmates of this part as distinguished from the debtors were comprised in four classes
one those awaiting trial
two persons under sentence of imprisonment for a fixed period or until they shall have paid certain fines
three transports awaiting removal to the colonies and four capital convicts condemned to death in awaiting execution
at one time the whole of these different categories were thrown together pell mell young and old
leun tried with the convicted
an imperfect attempt at classification was however made in eighteen twelve and a yard was as far as possible set apart for the untried
or class one with whom under the imperious demand for accommodation
were also associated the misdemeaniouns or class too
this was the chapel yard with its five wards which were calculated to hold seventy prisoners but often held many more
a further subclassification was attempted by separating at night those charged with misdemeanors from those charged with felony
but all mingled freely during the day in the yard
the sleeping accommodation in the chapel yard wards and indeed throughout the prison consisted of a barrack bed
which was a wooden flooring on a slightly inclined plane with a beam running across the top to serve as a pillow
no beds were issued only two rugs per prisoner
when each sleeper had the full lateral space allotted to him it amounted to one foot and a half on the barrack bed
but when the ward was obliged to accommodate double the ordinary number as was frequently the case
the sleepers covered the entire floor with the exception of a passage in the middle
all the misdemeanouts whatever their offence were lodged in this chapel ward
as many various and according to our ideas heinous crimes came under this head
in the then existing state of the law
the man guilty of a common assault found himself side by side with the fraudulent or others who had attempted abominable crimes
in this heterogeneous society were also thrown the unfortunate journalists to whom i have already referred and on whom imprisonment in newgate
was frequently adjudged for so called libels or two outspoken comments in print
it was particularly recommended by the committee on jails in eighteen fourteen
that some other and less mixed prison should be used for the confinement of persons convicted of libels but this suggestion was ignored
indeed the partial classification attempted seems to have been abandoned within a year or two
the hon h g bennet who visited newgate in eighteen seventeen saw in one yard in a total of seventy two prisoners
thirty five tried and thirty seven untried of the former three were transports for life
for for fourteen years and three of them persons sentenced to fines or short imprisonment one for a little more than a month
two of the untried were for murder and several for house breaking and highway robbery
nor were the misdiminuts and bale prisoners any longer separated from those whose crimes were of a more serious character
mister bennet refers to a gentleman confined for want of baile who occupied a room with five others
two committed by the bankruptcy commissioner one for perjury and two transports
persons convicted of publishing libels were still immured in the same room with transports and felons
the middle yard as far as its limits would permit was appropriated to felons and transports the wards here were generally very crowded
each word was calculated to hold twenty four allowing each individual one foot and a half
quote a common sized man says the keeper mister newman can turn in nineteen inches and quote
these twenty four could just sleep on the barrack bed when the number was higher and it often rose to forty the surplus had to sleep on the floor
the crowding was in consequence of the delay in removing transports
these often remained in newgate for six months sometimes a year in some cases longer
in one for seven years that of a man sentenced to death for whom great interest had been made but whom it was not thought right to pardon
occasionally the transports made themselves so useful in the jail that they were passed over
mister newman admitted that he had petitioned that certain trusty men might be left in the jail
constantly associated with these convicted felons were numbers of juveniles infants of tender years
there were frequently in the middle yard seven or eight children the youngest barely nine
the oldest only twelve or thirteen exposed to all the contaminating influences of the place
mister bennet mentions also the case of young men of better stamp clerks and city offices and youths of good parentage
quote in this dreadful situation and quote who had been rescued from the hulks through the kindness and attention of the secretary of state
quote yet they had been long enough he goes on to say in the prison associated with the lowest and vilest criminals
with convicts of all ages and characters to render it next to impossible but that with the obliteration of all sense of self respect
the inevitable consequence of such a situation their morals must have been destroyed
and though distress or the seduction of others might have led to the commission of this their first offence
yet the society they were driven to live in the language they daily heard and the lessons they were taught in this academy
must have had a tendency to turn them into the world hardened and accomplished in the ways of vice and crime and quote
mister buxton in the work already quoted instanceis another grievous case of the horrors of indiscriminate association in newgate
it was that of a person quote who practised in the law and who was connected by marriage with some very respectable families
having been committed to clerkenwell
he was sent on to newgate in a coach handcuffed to a noted housebreaker who was afterwards cast for death
the first night in newgate and for the subsequent fortnight
he slept in the same bed with a highwayman on one side and a man charged with murder on the other
spirits were freely introduced and although he at first abstained
he found he must adopt the manners of his companions or that his life would be in danger
they viewed him with some suspicion as one of whom they knew nothing
he was in consequence put out of the protection of their internal law and quote are code was a subject of some curiosity
when any prisoner committed an offence against the community or against an individual he was tried by a court in the jail
a prisoner generally the oldest and most dexterous thief
was appointed judge and a towel tied in knots was hung on each side in imitation of a wig
the judge sat in proper form he was punctiliously styled my lord
a jury having been selected and duly sworn
the culprit was then arraigned justice however was not administered with absolute integrity
a bribe to the judge was certain to secure acquittal and the neglect of the formality was as certainly followed by condemnation
various punishments were inflicted the heaviest of which was standing in the pillory
this was carried out by putting the criminal's head through the legs of a chair and stretching out his arms and tying them to the legs
the culprit was then compelled to carry the chair about with him
but all punishments might readily be commuted into a fine to be spent in gin for judge and jury
the prisoner mentioned above was continually persecuted by trials of this kind
the most trifling acts were magnified into offences
he was charged with moving something which should not be touched with leaving a door open or coughing maliciously to the disturbance of his companions
the evidence was invariably sufficient to convict and the judge never hesitated to inflict the heaviest penalties
the unfortunate man was compelled at length to adopt the habits of his associates
quote by insensible degrees he began to lose his repugnance to their society
caught their flash terms and sung their songs was admitted to their revels and acquired in place of habits of perfect sobriety
a taste for spirits and quote
his wife visited him in newgate and wrote a pitiable account of the state in which she found her husband
he was an inmate of the same ward with others of the most dreadful sort quote
whose language and manners whose female associates of the most abandoned description and the scenes consequent with such lost wretches
prevented me from going inside but seldom and i used to communicate with him through the bars from the passage and quote
one day he was too ill to come down and meet her
she went up to the ward and found him lying down quote
pale as death very ill and in a dreadfully dirty state the wretches making game of him and enjoying my distress
and i learned he had been up with the others the whole night
though they could not force him to gamble he was compelled to drink
and i was obliged afterwards to let him have five shillings to pay his share
otherwise he would have been stripped of his clothes and quote
felins who could pay the price were permitted irrespective of their character or offences
to purchase the greater ease and comfort of the master's side
the entrance fee was at least thirteen shillings sixpence a head with half a crown a week more for bed and bedding
the wards being furnished with barrack bedsteads upon which each prisoner had the regulation allowance of sleeping room
or about a foot and a half latterly these feeves were in reality a substantial contribution towards the expenses of the jail
without them the keeper declared that he could not pay the salaries of turnkeys and servants nor keep the prison going at all
besides the jail ties there was garnish of half a guinea collected by the steward
and spent in providing coals candles plates knives and forks while all the occupants of this part of the prison
supported themselves they had the ration of prison bread only
but they had no share in the prison meet or other charities and they were their friends found them in food
all who could scrape together the cash seemed to have gladly availed themselves of the privilege of entering the master's side
it was the only way to escape the horrors the distress penury an rags of the common yards
idleness was not so universally the rule in this part of the jail
artisans and others were at liberty to work at their trades provided they were not dangerous
tailoring and shoemaking was permitted but it was deemed unsafe to allow a carpenter or blacksmith to have his tools
all the money earned by prisoners was at their own disposal and was spent almost habitually in drink chambering and wantonness
the best accommodation the jail could offer was reserved for the prisoners on the state side
from whom still higher fees were exacted with the same discreditable idea of swelling the revenues of the prison
to constitute this the aristocratic quarter unwarrantable demands were made upon the space properly allotted to the female felons
and no lodger was rejected whatever his status who offered himself and could bring christ to the mill
the luxury of the state side was for a long time opene to all who could pay
the convicted felon the transport awaiting removal the lunatic whose case was still undecided
the misdemeanout tried or untried the debtor who wished to avoid the discomfort of the crowded debtors side the outspoken newspaper editor
or the daring reporter of parliamentary debates
the better class of inmate complaind bitterly of this enforced companionship with the vile
association at one time forbidden by custom but which greed and rapacity long made the rule
the fee for admission to the state side as fixed by the table of fees was three guineas but mister newman declared that he never took more than two
ten and sixpence a week more was charged as rent for a single bed where two or more slept in a bed the rent was seven shillings a week each
prisoners who could afford it sometimes paid for four beds at the rate of twenty eight shillings and so secured the luxury of a private room
a mister lunday charged with forgery was thus accommodated on the state side for upwards of five years
but the keeper protested that no single prisoner could thus monopolize space if the state side was crowded
the keeper went still further in his efforts to make money
he continued the ancient practice of letting out a portion of his own house and by a poetical fiction treated it as an annex of the state side
mister davison sent to newgate for embezzlement and whose case is given in the preceding chapter
was accommodated with a room in mister newman's house at the extravagant rental of thirty guineas per week
mister cobbett was also a lodger of mister newman's and so were any members of the aristocracy
if they happened to be in funds
among whom was the marquis of sligo in eighteen eleven
the female felons wards i shall describe at length in the next chapter
which will deal with missus fry's philanthropic exertions at this period in this particular part of the prison
these wards were always full to overflowing sometimes double the number the rooms could accommodate were crowded into them
there was a master's side for females who could pay the usual fees but they associated with the rest in the one narrow yard common to all
the tried and the untried young and old were herded together
sometimes girls of thirteen twelve even ten or nine years of age were exposed to quote
all the contagion and profligacy which prevailed in this part of the prison and quote
there was no separation even for the women under sentence of death who lived in a common and perpetually crowded ward
only when the order of execution came down were those about to suffer placed apart in one of the rooms in the arcade of the middle ward
i have kept till the last that part of the prison which was usually the last resting place of so many
the old press yard has been fully described in a previous chapter
the names still survived in the new press yard which was the receptacle of the male condemned prisoners it was generally crowded like the rest of the prison
except in murder cases where the execution was generally very promptly performed
strange and inconceivable delay occurred in carrying out the extreme sentence
hence there was a terrible accumulation of prisoners in the condemned cells
once during the long illness of george the third as many as one hundred were there waiting the report as it was called
at another time there were fifty one of whom had been under sentence a couple of years
mister bennet speaks of thirty eight capital convicts he found in the press yard in february eighteen seventeen
five of whom had been condemned the previous july four in september and twenty nine in october
this procrastination bred certain callousness
few realizing that the dreadful fate would overtake them dismissed the prospect of death
and until the day was actually fixed spent the time in roistering swearing gambling or playing at ball
visitors were permitted access to them without stint
unlimited drink was not denied them provided it was obtained in regulated quantities at one time
these capital convicts says mister bennet quote lessened the enui and despair of their situation by unbecoming merriment
or sought relief in the constant application of intoxicating stimulants
i saw cashmin a few hours before his execution smoking and drinking with the utmost unconcern and indifference and quote
those who were thus reckless reacted upon the penitent who knew their days were numbered
and their jibes and jollity counteracted the ordinary's councils or the independent preachers earnest prayers
for while roman catholics and dissenters were encouraged to see ministers of their own persuasion
a number of amateurs were ever ready to give their gratuitous ministrations to the condemned
the prisoners in the press yard had free excess during the day to the yard and large day room
at night they were placed in the fifteen cells two three or more together according to the total number to be accommodated
they were never left quite alone for fear of suicide and for the same reason they were searched for weapons or poisons
but they nevertheless frequently managed to secrete the means of making away with themselves and accomplished their purpose
convicted murderers were kept continuously in the cells on bread and water
in couples from the time of sentence to that of execution which was about three or four days generally
from friday to monday so as to include one sunday on which day there was a special service for the condemned in the prison chapel
this latter was an ordeal which all dreaded and many avoided by denying their faith
the condemned occupied an open pew in the centr of the chapel hung with black in front of them upon a table was a black coffin in full view
the chapel was filled with a curious but callous congregation who came to stare at the miserable people thus publicly exposed
well might mister bennesh write that the condition of the condemned side was the most prominent of the manyfold evils in the present system of newgate
quote so discreditable to the metropolis and quote
yet it must have been abundantly plain to the reader that the other evils existing were great and glaring a brief summary obum will best prove this
the jail was neither suitable nor sufficiently large it was not even kept weather tight
the roof of the female prison says the grand jury in their presentment in eighteen thirteen let in the rain
supplies of common necessaries such as have now been part of the furniture of every british jail for many years
were meagre or altogether absent
the rations of food were notoriously inadequate and so carelessly distributed that many were left to starve
so unjust and unequal was the system that the allowance to convicted criminals was better than that of the innocent debtor
and the general insufficiency was such
that it multiplied beyond all reason the number of visitors many of whom came merely as the purveyors of food to their friends
the prison allowances were eked out by the broken victuals generously given by several eating house keepers in the city
such as measures birch of cornhill and messrs leech and dolamore of ludgate hill
these were fetched away in a large tub on a truck by a turnkey
amongst the heap was often the meat that had made turtle soup which when heated and stirred together in a saucepan was said to be very good eating
the bedding was scanty
fuel and light had to be purchased out of prisoner's private means clothing was issued but rarely
even to prisoners almost in nakedness and as a special charitable gift extortion was practised right and left
garnish continued to be demanded long after it had disappeared in other and better regulated prisons
the fees on reception and discharge must be deemed exorbitant when it is remembered the impoverished class who usually crowded the jail
and they were exacted to relieve a rich corporation from paying for the maintenance of their own prison
this imposition of fees left prisoners destitute on their discharge without funds to support them in their first struggle to recommence life
with ruined character bad habits and oftin bad health contracted in the jail
a further and more iniquitous method of extorting money
was still practised that of loading newly arrived prisoners until they paid certain fies
ironing was still the rule not only for the convicted but for those charged with felonies only the misdemeanons escaped
at the commencement of every sessions such of the untried as had purchased easement of irons were called up and refettered
preparatory to their appearance in the old bailey irons were seldom removed from the convicted until discharge
sometimes the wearer was declared medically unfit or he obtained release by long good conduct
or the faithful discharge of some petty office such as gatesmen or captain of a ward
the irons weighed from three to four pounds but heavier irons seven or eight pounds weight
were imposed in case of misconduct and when there had been an attempt at escape
the culprit was chained down to the floor by running a chain through his irons which prevented him from climbing to the window of his cell
among other excuses offered for thus manacling all almost without exception was that it was the best and safest method
of distinguishing a prisoner from a stranger and temporary visitor
clothes or prison uniform would not have served the purpose for a disguise can be rapidly and secretly put on
whereas irons cannot well be exchanged without loss of time and attracting much attention
the unchecked admission of crowds of visitors to the felons as well as the debtor side was another unmixed evil
by this means spirits otherwise unattainable and strictly prohibited were smuggled into the jail
searches were made certainly but they were too often superficial or they might be evaded by a trifling bribe
hence the frequent cases of drunkenness of which no notice was taken unless people grew riotous in their cups
and attracted attention by their disorderly behavior
another frightful consequence of this indiscriminate admission was the influx of numbers of abandoned women
only a few of whom had the commendable prudery to pass themselves off as the wives of prisoners
eddie reputed and indeed any real wife might spend the night in newgate if she would pay the shilling fee commonly known as the bad money
which might have done something towards increasing the prison receipts had it not been appropriated by the turnkey who winked at this evasion of the rules
among the daily visitors were members of the criminal classes still at large
the thieves and burglars who carried on the active business of their profession from which their confederates were temporarily debarred
one notorious character while a prisoner awaiting transfer to the hulks
kept open house so to speak and entertained daily within the walls a select party of the most noted thieves in london
this delectable society enticed into their set a clerk who had been imprisoned for fraud
and offered him half the booty if he would give full information as to the transactions and correspondents of his late employers
owing to the facility of intercourse between inside and outside many crimes were doubtless hatched in newgate
some of the worst and most extensive burglaries were planned there
i believe says mister bennet in the letter already largely quoted
that there is no place in the metropolis where more crimes are projected or where stolen property is more secreted than in newgate
these mal practices were fostered by the absence of all supervision and the generally unbroken idleness
although attempted partially at bridewell and more systematically at the new millbank penitentiary
but just open eighteen sixteen the regular employment of prisoners had never yet been accepted as a principle in the metropolitan prisons
insuperable difficulties were still supposed to stand in the way of any general employment of prisoners at their trades
there was fear as to the unrestricted use of tools
limits of space the interference of the ill disposed who would neither work nor let others do so
and the danger of losing material raw or manufactured
many years were to elapse before these objections should be fairly met and universally overcome
it was not strange therefore that the inmates of newgate should turn their unoccupied brains and idle hands to all manner of mischief
that when they were not carousing plotting or scheming
they should gambl with dice or cards and play at bumble puppy or some other disreputable game of chancs
the report of the committee of the house of commons painted so black a picture of newgate as then conducted that the corporation were roused in very shame
to undertake some kind of reform
the above mentioned report was ordered to be printed upon the ninth may
upon the twenty ninth july the same year
the court of aldermen appointed a committee of its own body assisted by the town clerk mister dants city surveyor son to the architect of newgate
and mister addison keeper of newgate to make a visitation of the jails supposed to be the best managed including those of petworth and gloucester
this committee was to compare allowances examine rules and certify as to the condition of prisoners
also to make such proposals as might appear salutary and calculated to improve newgate and the rest of the city jails
this committee made its report in september the following year and an excellent report it is so far as its recommendations are concerned
the committee seems to have fully realized even at this early date eighteen fifteen
many of the indispensable conditions of a model prison according to modern ideas
it admitted the paramount necessity
for giving every prisoner a sleeping cell to himself an amount of enlightenment which is hardly general among european nations at this
the latter end of the nineteenth century several of which still fall far short of our english ideal
that all prisoners should always be in separate cells by night and those of short sentences by day
it recommended daysails or rooms for regular labour which should be compulsory upon all transports and prisoners sentenced to hard labor
the work being constant and suitable with certain hours of relaxation and for food and exercise
the personal cleanliness of all prisoners was to be insisted upon they should be made to wash at least once a day
with the penalty of forfeiting the day's allowance of food and increase of which the committee had recommended
the provision of more baths was also suggested and the daily sweeping out of the prison
the clothes of prisoners arriving dirty or in rags should be fumigated before worn in the jail
but as yet no suggestion was made to provide prison uniform
a laundry should be established and a matron appointed on the female side where all the prisoner's washing could be performed
proper hours for locking and unlocking prisoners should be insisted upon
a bell should give notice thereof and of meal hours working hours or of escapes
the committee took upon itself to lay down stringent rules for the discipline of the prison
the jailer should be required to visit every part and see every prisoner daily the chaplain should perform service visit the sick
instruct the prisoners quote give spiritual advice and administer religious consolation and quote to all who might need them
the surgeon should see all prisoners whether ill or well once a week and take general charge of the infirmaries
all three governor chaplain and surgeon should keep journals which should be inspected periodically by the visiting magistrates
it should be peremptorily forbidden to the keeper or any officer to make a pecuniary profit out of the supplies of food fuel or other necessaries
no prisoner should be allowed to obtain superior accommodation on the payment of any fees these indeed should be generally abolished garnish also
no prisoners should in future be ironed except in cases of misconduct
provided only that their security was not jeopardized and dependent upon the enforcement of another new rule
which recommended restrictions upon the number of visitors admitted
no wine or beer should be in future admitted into or sold in the jail
except for the use of the debtors or as medical comforts for the infirmary
drunkenness if it ever occurred should be visited with severe punishment
gaming of all sorts should be peremptorily forbidden under heavy pains and penalties
the feelings of the condemned prisoners should no longer be outraged by their exposure in the chapel and the chapel should be rearranged
so that the various classes might be seated separately and so as not to see each other
it will hardly be denied that these proposals went to the root of the matter
had they been accepted in their entirety little fault could in future have been found with the managers of newgate
in common justice to them it must be admitted that immediate effect was given to all that could be easily carried out
the state side ceased to exist and the female prisoners thus regained the space of which their quadrangle had been robbed
the privileges of the master's side also disappeared
fees were nominally abolished and garnish was scotched although not yet killed outright
a certain number of bedsteads were provided and there was a slight increase in the ration of bread
but here the recommendations touched at once upon the delicate subject of expense and it is clear that the committee hesitated on this score
it made this too the excuse for begging the most important issue of the whole question
the committee did not deny the superior advantages offered by such prisons as gloucester and petworth
but it at once deprecated the idea that the city could follow the laudable example thus set in the provinces quote
where a metropolitan prison erected on the same lines with all the space not only for air and exercise but for day rooms and sleeping cells
and quote it would cover some thirty acres and cost a great deal more than the city with the example of white cross street prison before it
could possibly afford
the committee does not seem to have yet understood that newgate could be only and properly replaced
by a new jail built on the outskirts as holloway eventually was and permitted itself to be altogether countered
and checked in its efforts towards reform by the prohibitory costliness of the land about newgate
with the seeming impossibility of extending the limits of the prison as it then stood
all chances of classification and separation vanished and the greatest evils remained untouched
all the committee could do in this respect was to throw the responsibility on others
it pointed out that the government was to blame for the overcrowding and might diminish it if it chose
it was very desirable that there should be a more speedy removal of transports from newgate to the ships
again there was the new mill bank penitentiary now ready for occupation
why not relieve newgate by drawing more largely upon the superior accommodation which billbank offered
the chronicles of newgate volume two by arthur griffith's section seven the beginnings of prison reform
while missus fry was diligently engaged upon her self imposed task in newgate
other earnest people inspired doubtless by her noble example were stirred up to activity in the same great work
it began to be understood that prisoner form could only be compassed by continuous and combined effort
the pleadings however eloquent of a single individual were unable to more than partially remedy the widespread and colossal evils of british prisons
howard's energy and devotion were rewarded by lively sympathy but the desire to improve which followed his exposures was but short lived
it was so powerless against the persistent neglect of those entrusted with prison management that five and twenty years later
mister neeld a second howard
as indefatigable and self sacrificing found by personal visitation that the condition of jails throughout the kingdom was
with a few bright exceptions still deplorable and disgraceful
mister neeld was compelled to admit in eighteen twelve that the great reformation produced by howard
was in several places merely temporary
some prisons that had been ameliorated under the persuasive influence of his kind advice were relapsing into their former horrid state of privation
filthiness severity or neglect many new dungeons had aggravated the evils against which his sagacity could not but remonstrate
the motives for a transient amendment were becoming paralyzed and the effect had ceased with the cause
i have shown in a previous chapter what newgate was at this period despite a vast expenditure and boasted efforts to introduce reforms
some of the county jails and one or two burrow jails had been rebuilt
generally through the personal activity of influential and benevolent local magnates but the true principles of prison construction
were as yet but imperfectly understood and such portions of the improved jails of that period as were still extant a few years back
contrast ludicrously with the prison architecture based upon a century's experience of our own age
the neglect of prison reform in those days was not to be visited upon the legislature
the executive although harassed by internal commotion and foreign war was not entirely callous to the crying need for amelioration in jails
measures were medial although at best partial and incomplete were introduced from time to time
thus in eighteen thirteen the exaction of jail fees had been forbidden by law
and two other acts more peremptory and precise followed on the same subject in succeeding years
in eighteen fourteen a bill was brought in to insist upon the appointment of chaplains in jails and when this had passed into law
it was subsequently amplified in the rates of salaries fixed
various acts were also passed to consolidate an amend previous jail acts
the erection of new prison buildings was made imperative under certain conditions and following certain rules
the principle of classification was freshly enunciated prison regulations were framed for general observance
but the effect of this legislation was rather weakened by the remoteness of the pressure exercised
the honus of improvement lay upon the magistracy the local authorities administering local funds
and they were not threatened with any particular penalties if they evaded or ignored the new acts
moreover the law is applied more particularly to county jurisdictions
the borro jails those in fact under corporate management were not included in the new measures
it was hoped that their rulers would hire accommodation in the county prisons and that the inferior establishments would in course of time disappear
yet the burrow jails were destined to survive many years and to exhibit for a long time to come all the worst features of jail mismanagement
it was in eighteen seventeen that a small band of philanthropists resolved to form themselves into an association for the improvement of prison discipline
they were hopeless of any general reform by the action of the executive alone
they felt that private enterprise might
with advantage step in and by the collection and diffusion of information and the reiteration of sound advice greatly assist the good work
the association was organized under the most promising auspices
a king's son the duke of glocester was the patron among the vice presidents were many great peers of the realm
several bishops and a number of members of the house of commons including mister manner's sutton
mister sturgis born sir james mackintosh sir james scarlett and william wilberforce
an active committee was appointed comprising many names already well known some of them destined to become famous in the annals of philanthropy
one of the moving spirits was the hon h g bennet m p whose vigorous protests against the lamentable condition of newgate have already been recorded
missus fry's brother mister samuel hore junior was chairman of the committee on which also served many noted members of the society of friends
mister gurniy mister fry messrs forster and mister t f buxton the coadjutor of wilberforce in the great anti slavery struggle
mister buxton had already been associated with missus fry in the newgate visitation and his attention had thus been drawn to the neglected state of english present
when in belgium he had examined with great satisfaction the admirable management of the great maison de force at gene
which howard had eulogized some forty years before
in order to give greater value to the pamphlet
he personally visited several english jails and pointed his observations by drawing forcible contrasts between the good and bad
mister buxton's small work on prison discipline gave a new aspect to the question he had so much at heart
for the first time the doctrine was enunciated that prisoners had rights of their own
the untried and in the eyes of the law still innocent could claim pure air wholesome and sufficient food and opportunities for exercise
they had aright mister buxton affirmed to be employed in their own crafts provided it could be safely followed in prison
you have no right he says addressing the authorities to subject a prisoner to suffering from cold
by want of bedclothing by night or firing by day
and the reason is plain you have taken him from his home and have deprived him of the means of providing himself with the necessaries or comforts of life
and therefore you are bound to furnish him with moderate indeed but suitable accommodation
you have for the same reason he goes on no right to ruin his habits by compelling him to be idle
his morals by compelling him to mix with a promiscuous assemblage of hardened and convicted criminals
or his health by forcing him at night into a damp unventilated cell with such crowds of companions as very speedily render the air foul and putrid
or to make him sleep in close contact with the victims of contagious and loathsome disease
or amidst the noxious effluvia of dirt and corruption
in short attention to his feelings mental and bodily a supply of every necessary abstraction from evil society
the conservation of his health and industrious habits are the clear evident undeniable rights of an unconvicted prisoner
nor even when found guilty and his liberty forfeited did his privileges cease the law appointed a suitable punishment for the offence
it was for those charged with the administration of the law to guard carefully against any aggravation of that punishment
to see that no circumstances of severity are found in his treatment which are not found in his sentence
no judge ever condemned a man to be half perished with cold by day or half suffocated with heat by night
who ever heard of a criminal being sentenced to catch the rheumatism or the typhus fever
disease cold famine nakedness and contagious and polluted air are not lawful punishments in the hands of the civil magistrates
nor has he a right to poison or starve his fellow creatures
the convicted delinquent has his right said mister buxton authoritatively
all measures and practices in prison which may injure him in any way are illegal
because they are not specified in his sentence he is therefore entitled to a wholesome atmosphere
decent clothing and bedding and a diet sufficient to support him
these somewhat novel but undoubtedly indisputable propositions were backed up not by sound arguments only but by the letter of the law
as mister buxton pointed out many old acts of parliament designed to protect the prisoner were still in full force
some might be in abeyance but they had never been repealed and some were quite freshly imported upon the statute book
as far back as the reign of charles the second a law was past declaring that sufficient provision should be made for the relief and setting on work
of poor and needy prisoners committed to the common jail for felony and other misdemeanors who many times perish before their trial
and the poor there living idle and unemployed become debauched and come forth instructed in the practice of fevery and lewdness
as a remedy justices of the peace were empowered to provide materials for the setting of poor prisoners to work
and to pay overseers or instructors out of the county rates
again the twenty two charles the second c twenty ordered the jailer to keep felons and debtors separate and apart from one another
in distinct rooms on pain of forfeiting his office and trebled damages to the party aggrieved
a much later act the fourteen george the third see fifty nine seventeen seventy four
which was contemporaneous with howard's first journeys laid down precise rules as regards cleanliness and the proper supply of space and air
this act set forth that whereas the malignant fever commonly called the jail distemper
is found to be owing to want of cleanliness and fresh air in the several jails
the fatal consequences whereof might be prevented if the justices of the peace were duly authorized
to provide such accommodations in jeils as may be necessary to answer this salutary purpose
it is enacted that the justices shall order the walls of every room to be scraped and whitewashed once every year
ventilators hand and others were to be supplied
an infirmary consisting of two distinct rooms one for males and one for females should be provided for the separate accommodation of the sick
warm and cold baths or commodious bathing tubs
were to be kept in every jail and the prisoners directed to wash in them before release these provisions were almost a dead letter
yet another act passed in seventeen ninety one if properly observed should have ensured proper attention to them
by the thirty one george the third c forty six s five
two or more justices were appointed visitors of prisons and directed to visit and inspect three times every quarter
they were to report in writing to quarter sessions as to the state of the jail and as to all abuses which they might observe therein
the most important jail act of that early period however was the twenty fourth george third see fifty four s four seventeen eighty four
which was the first legislative attempt to compel the classification of prisoners or their separation into classes
according to their categories or crimes
it was made incumbent upon the justices to provide distinct places of confinement for five classes of prisoners vis
one prisoners convicted of felony two prisoners committed on a charge or suspicion of felony
three prisoners guilty of misdemeanors four prisoners charged with misdemeanors five debtors
it was further ordered that male prisoners should be kept perfectly distinct from the females
kings evidences were also to be lodged apart
infirmaries separating the sexes were also to be provided a chapel too and warm and cold baths
care also was to be taken that the prisoners shall not be kept in any apartment underground
in an early report of the prison discipline improvement society
published some six and thirty years after the promulgation of this act the flagrant and persistent violations of it and others
which had continued through that long period are forcibly pointed out
in eighteen eighteen out of five hundred and eighteen prisons in the united kingdom
to which a total of upwards of one hundred thousand prisoners had been committed in the year only twenty three prisons were divided according to law
fifty nine had no division whatever to separate males and females one hundred and thirty six had only one division for the purpose
sixty eight had only two divisions and so on
in four hundred and forty five prisons no work of any description had been introduced for the employment of prisoners
in the balance some work was done but with the most meagre results
the want of room was still a crying evil
in one hundred jails
capable of accommodating only eight thousand five hundred and forty five persons as many as thirteen thousand and fifty seven were crowded
many of the jails were in the most deplorable condition
incommodious as has been stated insecure unhealthy and unprovided with the printed or written regulations required by law
to specify more particularly one or two of the worst it may be mentioned that in the borough copter
the old evils of indiscriminate association still continued unchecked
all prisoners passed their time in absolute idleness or killed it by gambling in loose conversation
the debtors were crowded almost inconceivably
in a space twenty feet long by six wide
twenty men slept on eight straw beds with sixteen rugs amongst them and a piece of timber for a bolster
mister buxton who found this declared that it seemed physically impossible but he was assured that it was true
and that it was accomplished by sleeping edgeways
one poor wretch who had slept next to the wall said he had been literally unable to move for the pressure
in the morning the stenced heat were so oppressive that he and everyone else on waking rushed unclothed into the yard
and the turnkey told mister buxton that the smell on first opening the door was enough to knock down a horse
the hospital was filled with infectious cases and in one room seven feet by nine with closed windows
where a lad lay ill with fever
three other prisoners at first perfectly healthy were lodged of course they were seized with the fever
so that the culprit in addition to his sentence
had to endure by the regulations of the city a disease very dangerous in its nature and ran the risk of a lingering and painful death
at guildford prison which mister buxton also visited in eighteen eighteen
there was no infirmary
no chapel no work no classification
the irons which nearly everyone wore were remarkably heavy those double ironed could not take off their small clothes
no prison dress was allowed and half the inmates were without shirts or shoes or stockings
the dient was limited to dry bread which was of the best certainly and a pound and a half in weight
matters were on much the same footing at saint alban's
they were far worse at bristol
although at mister buxton's visit a new jail was in process of erection the first step towards reform since howard's visitation in seventeen seventy four
in eighteen eighteen the old jail was so densely packed that it was nearly impossible to pass through the yards for the throng
one hundred and fifty were lodged in a prison just capable of holding fifty two
in the crowd all of them persons who had no other avocation or mode of livelihood but thieving mister buxton counted eleven children
children hardly old enough to be released from the nursery
all charged with felony were in heavy irons without distinction of age
all were in ill health
almost all were in rags
almost all were filthy in the extreme
the state of the prison the desperation of the prisoners broadly hinted in their conversation and plainly expressed in their conduct
the uproar of oaths complaints and obscenity
the indescribable stench presented together a concentration of the utmost misery and the utmost guilt
it was a scene of infernal passions and distresses says buxton which few have imaginations sufficient to picture
and of which fewere still
would believe that the original is to be found in this enlightened and happy country
there was still worse to come
having explored the yards and adjacent day rooms and sleeping cells a door was unlocked
the visitors were furnished with candles and they descended eighteen long steps into a vault
at the bottom was a circular space through which ran a narrow passage and the sides of which were fitted with barrack bedsteads
the floor was on the level of the river and very damp
the smell at one o'clock of the day was something more than can be expressed by the term disgusting
on the dirty bedstead lay a wretched being in the throes of severe illness
the only ventilation of this pit this dark cheerless damp unwholesome cavern a dungeon in its worst sense
was by a kind of chimney which the prisoners kept hermetically sealed and which had never been opened in the memory of the turnkey
untried persons were often lodged in this nauseous underground den
and sometimes slept in the kit loaded with heavy irons for a whole year waiting the jail delivery
confinement for twelve months in the bristol jail was counted a punishment equivalent to seven years transportation
in this prison there was no female infirmary
sick women and their children remained in the ordinary wards and propagated disease
no prison dress was allowed
no reception room was provided
no soap towels or baths
the bedclothes consisted only of a single very slight rug
the allowance of food daily to felons was a fourpenny loaf
a price which in those days fluctuated enormously as much as a hundred per cent in a couple of years
but as no similar variation occurred in the prisoner's appetite his ration was somewhat precarious
as for the debtors they had no allowance whatever and were often in imminent danger of starvation
with all this the inmates were crowded together at night to such a degree as to excite surprise that they should escape suffocation
there reigned through the whole edifice a chilly damp unwholesome atmosphere and the effluvia from the prisoners was so nauseous
that the chaplain found it necessary to take his place before they entered chapel as he could not otherwise have faced the smell
it is consoling to know that there were a few brilliant exceptions to this cruel callous neglect
already as early as eighteen eighteen a prison existed at bury saint edmunds which was a model for imitation to others at that time
and which he even fulfilled many of the exacting requirements of modern days
the great principles of classification cleanliness and employment were closely observed
there were eighty four separate sleeping cells and unless the jail was overcrowded every inmate passed the night alone
and in comparative comfort with a bed and proper bedding
the prison stood on a dry airy situation outside the town
prisoners on reception were treated as they are nowadays bathed dressed in prison clothes and inspected by the surgeon
no irons were worn except as a punishment
personal cleanliness was insisted upon and all parts of the prison were kept scrupulously clean
there was an infirmary properly found and duly looked after
no idleness was permitted among the inmates trades were taught or prisoners were allowed to follow their own if suitable
there was besides a mill for grinding corn somewhat similar to a turnspit which prisoners turned by walking in rows
this made exertion compulsory and imposed hard labor as a proper punishment
another jail that of ilchester was also worthy of all commendation it exhibited all the good points of that at bury
at ilchester the rule of employment had been carried further
a system not adopted generally till nearly half a century later had already prevailed at ilchester
the new jail had been in a great measure constructed by the prisoners themselves
masons bricklayers carpenters painters had been employed upon the buildings and the work was pronounced excellent by competent judges
industrial labor had also been introduced with satisfactory results
blanket weaving and cloth spinning was carried on prosperously
and all the material for prisoners apparel was manufactured in the jail
there were workrooms for wool washing dying carting and spinning
the looms were constantly busy tailors were always at work and every article of clothing and bedding was made up within the walls
there was a prison laundry too where all the prisoner's linen was regularly washed
the moral welfare of the inmates was as closely looked after as physical
there was an attentive chaplain a schoolmaster and regular religious and other instruction
compared with those highly meritorious institutions newgate still showed but badly
its evils were inherent and irremediable but some ameliorating measures have been introduced
mainly through the exertions of a new governor mister brown who succeeded mister newman at newgate in eighteen seventeen
the most noticeable of the improvements introduced was a better regulation of dietaries within the prison
the old haphazard system by which meat was issued in bulk
a week's allowance at a time was abolished and there was a regular scale of daily rations adopted
the diet was now ample it consisted of a pound and a half of bread per dim
for breakfast a pint of gruel for dinner half a pound of boiled meat or a quart of soup with vegetables on alternate days
the food was properly prepared in the prison kitchen
meat was no longer issued raw to be imperfectly cook before a ward fire and bolted gluttonously the whole two pounds at one sitting
mister brown confidently asserted that no jail in england now fed its inmates so well as did newgate
so plentiful was this dietary that although the old permission remained in force of allowing the friends of prisoners to bring them supplies from outside
the practice was falling into abeyance and the prisoner seldom required private assistance to eke out their meals
it was also claimed for the more ample and more orderly distribution of victuals that the general health of the prisoners had greatly improved
mister brown also much to his own credit brought about the abandonment of the practice of ironing all prisoners as a matter of course
in eighteen eighteen prisoners awaiting trial in newgate were at length relieved from this illegal infliction
convicts were not even compelled to wear irons providing they behaved well
it was found that shackles might be safely dispensed with even in the case of the most desperate characters
this was effected by stopping the nearly indiscriminate admission of visitors which had hitherto prevailed all over the jail
ironing it will be remembered was a distinguishing badge so that when the jail was cleared the free might be readily known from the captive and escapes prevented
under the new rule visitors were not allowed to pass into the interior of the prison but were detained between the grating
this change led to some discontent until it was found that the much greater boon of relief from irons accompanied it and the reform was quietly accepted
indeed the best consequences followed from the removal of irons the prisoners were much better disposed there were no riots and fewer disturbances
but nothing short of radical reform and complete reconstruction could touch the deep seated evils of association overcrowding and idleness
the first still produced deplorable results results to be observable for many years to come
mister buxton mentions the case of a boy whose apparent innocence and artlessness had attracted his attention
he had been committed for an offence for which he was acquitted
he left newgate utterly corrupted and after lapsing into crime soon returned with a very different character
other cases of moral deterioration have already been recorded
some attempt was made to reduce the overcrowding on the recommendation of the house of commons committee of eighteen eighteen but this applied only a partial remedy
the bulk of the prisoners were still left in idleness
a few fortunate criminals many of them kept back from transportation on purpose who were skilled in trades were employed at them
painters plasterers and carpenters were allowed to follow their handicrafts with the reward of sixpence per dim and a double allowance of food
they used their own tools and this without any dangerous consequences as regards facilitating the escape of others
thus disposing of the objection so long raised against the industrial employment of prisoners in newgate
but this bone of toil was denied to all but a very limited number
as the prison disciplined society pertinently observed in a report dated eighteen twenty
it is obvious that reformation must be materially impeded and in some cases utterly defeated when the prisoners are defectively classed
the chronicles of newgate volume two by arthur griffith's section eight the beginnings of prison reform
newgate prisoners were the victims to another most objectionable practice which obtained all over london
persons committed to a metropolitan jail at that time were taken in gangs men and women handcuffed together or linked onto a long chain
unless they could afford to pay for a vehicle out of their own funds
even then they were not certain of the favor for i find reference to a decent and respectable woman sent to newgate
who handed a shilling to the escort warder to provide her with a hackney coach but this functionary pocketed the cash and obliged the woman to walk
chained to the rest as the miserable crew filed through the public streets exposed to the scornful gaze of every passenger
they were followed by a crowd of reckless boys who jeered at and insulted them
many thus led in procession were in a shocking condition of dirt and misery frequently nearly naked and often bearing upon them
the germs more or less developed of contagious disease caravans the forerunners of the prison vans
were first made use of about eighteen twenty seven that the need for prison reform was imperative may be gathered from the few out of many instances i have adduced
yet there were those who wedded to ancient ideas er intolerant of change they would not admit the existence of any evils
one smug alderman a member of the house of commons sneered at the ultra philanthropy of the champions of prison improvement
speaking on a debate on prison matters he declared that
our prisoners have all that prisoners ought to have
without gentlemen think they ought to be indulged with turkey carpets
the society for the improvement of prison discipline was taxed with a desire to introduce a system
tending to divest punishment of its just and salutary terrors
an imputation which the society indignantly and very justly repudiated the statement being as they said
refuted by abundant evidence and having no foundation whatever in truth
among those whom the society found arrayed against it was sydney smith
who in a caustic article contributed to the edinburgh review protested against the pampering of criminals
while fully admitting the good intentions of the society he condemned their ultra humanitarianism as misplaced
he took exception to various of the proposals of the society he thought they leaned too much to a system of indulgence and education in jails
he objected to the instruction of prisoners in reading and writing
a poor man who is lucky enough he said to have his son committed for a felony
educates him under such a system for nothing while the virtuous simpleton who was on the other side of the wall is paying by the quarter for these attainments
he was altogether against too liberal a diet he disapproved of industrial occupations in jails as not calculated to render prisons terrible
there should be no tea and sugar
uh
no assemblage of female felons around the washing tub
nothing but beating hemp and pulling oakum and pounding bricks
no work but what was tedious unusual
in prisons which are really meant to keep the multitude in order and to be a terror to evil doers there must be no sharings of profits
no visiting of friends no education but religious education
no freedom of diet
no weavers looms or carpenters benches there must be a great deal of solitude
coarse food
a dress of shame
hard incessant
irksome eternal labor a planned and regulated and unrelenting exclusion of happiness and comfort
undeterred by these sarcasms and misrepresentations
the society pursued its laudable undertaking with remarkable energy and great singleness of purpose
the objects it had in view were set forth in one of its earliest meetings
it sought to obtain and diffuse useful information
to suggest beneficial regulations
and circulate tracts demonstrating the advantages of classification
constant inspection regular employment and humane treatment generally with religious and moral instruction
it earnestly advocated the appointment of female officers to take exclusive charge of female prisoners

a much needed and according to our ideas indispensable reform already initiated by the ladies committee at newgate
it made the subject of the newly invented tread wheels or stepping wheels as they were at first called its peculiar affair
and obtained full details
from places where they had been adopted of the nature of these new machines
the method by which they were worked and the dietaries of the prisoners employed upon them
nor did it confine itself to mere verbal recommendations
the good it tried to do took active shape
in the establishment of temporary refuges
at hoxton for mails and in the hackney road for females
for the reception of deserving cases discharged from prison
the governor of newgate and other metropolitan prisons
had orders of admission to this refuge
which he could bestow on prisoners on release
and so save the better disposed or the completely destitute
from lapsing at once into crime
the refuge which had for its object the training of its inmates
in habits of industry
and in moral and religious duty and which after a time sought to provide them with suitable situations was supported entirely out of the funds of the society
at the time of its greatest prosperity its annual income from donations and subscriptions was about
one thousand six hundred pounds
another point to which the society devoted infinite pains
was the preparation of plans for the guidance of architects in the construction of prisons

a very valuable volume
published by the society
traced the progress of prison architecture from the days when the jail was the mere annex of the baronial or episcopal castle
or a dungeon above or below the gate of a town to the first attempts at systematic reconstruction carried out under the advice and supervision of howard
it is interesting to observe that the plan of radiation
by which the prison blocks radiated from a central hall like spokes in a wheel
was introduced as early as seventeen ninety by mister blackbirn
an architect of eminence who was very largely employed in the erection of prison buildings at the close of the last century
with some important modifications
this principle of radiation is still the rule
the society did not limit its remarks to the description of what had already been done
but it offered suggestions for future buildings
with numerous carefully executed drawings and designs of the model it recommended for imitation
experience has since shown that in some respects these plans are defective
especially in the placing of the governor's residence in the centr of the prison
it was thought that this would guarantee constant supervision and inspection but it did nothing of the kind and only the presence of warders on duty
is found nowadays to be really efficacious the main recommendations however are based upon common sense
and none are more commendable than that which deprecates the excessive ornamentation of the external parts of the edifice
the new jails as howard says having pompous fronts appear like palaces to the lower class of people and many persons are against them on this account
the present society reproves the misdirected efforts of ambitious architects who by a lavish and improvident expenditure of public money
sought to rank the prisons they built among the most splendid buildings of the city or town
absence of embellishment is in perfect unison with the character of the establishment
these are principles fully recognized nowadays and it may fairly be conceded that the prison disciplined society's ideal
differed little from that kept in view in the construction of the latest and best modern jails
after a few years of active exertion the society was rewarded by fresh legislation
to its efforts and their effect upon parliament and the public mind we must attribute the new jail acts of four george the fourth
cap sixty four and five george the fourth kept eighty five
which having gone through several sessions at last became law in eighteen twenty three to four
by the preamble of the first named act
it was declared
expedient to introduce such measures and arrangements as shall not only provide for the safe custody
but shall also tend more effectually to preserve the health
and improve the morals of the prisoners and shall ensure the proper measure of punishment to convicted offenders
accordingly due provision was made for the enforcement of hard labor
on all prisoners sentenced to it
and for the employment of all others
unless such ability to work
should cease by reason of sickness
infirmity the want of sufficient work or from any other cause
it was distinctly laid down that male and female prisoners should be confined in separate buildings or parts of the prison
so as to prevent them from seeing
conversing
or holding any intercourse with each other
classification was insisted upon
in the manner laid down by the twenty fourt george the third
cap fifty four
with such further separation as the justices should deem conducive to good order and discipline
female prisoners were in all cases to be under the charge of female officers

every prison containing female prisoners was to have a matron
who was to reside constantly in the prison
the religious and moral welfare of the prisoners were to be attended to
the first by daily services the latter by the appointment of schoolmasters and instruction in reading and writing
last but not least the use of irons was strictly forbidden
except in cases of urgent and absolute necessity
and every prisoner was to be provided with a hammock or cot to himself suitable bidding
and if possible a separate cell
the second act passed in the following year
enlarged and amended the first
and at the same time gave powers to the house
to call for information
as to the observance of its provisions
the promulgation of these two jail act
strengthened the hands of the prison disciplined society enormously
it had now a legal and authoritative standard of efficiency to apply
and could expose all the local authorities that still lagged behind or neglected to comply with the provisions of the new laws
the society did not shrink from itself imposed duty
but continued year after year with unflagging energy and unflinching spirit to watch closely
and report at length upon the condition of the
prisons of the country
for this purpose it kept up an extensive correspondence with all parts of the kingdom
and circulated queries to be answered in detail
whence it deduced the practice and condition of every prison that replied
upon these and the private visitations made by various members the society obtained the facts
often highly damnatory
which were embodied in its annual reports
the progress of improvement was certainly extremely slow
it was long before the many jurisdictions imitated the few
jails of which the old prison at redding was a specimen
were still left in tact
in that prison
with its cells and yards arranged within the shell of an ancient abbey chapel
the prisoners without firing
betting or sufficient food spent their days in surveying their grotesque prison
or contriving some means of escape by climbing the fluted columns which supported
the gothic arches of the isles
and so
passing by the roof down into the garden and on to freedom
in a county prison adjoining the metropolis
the separation between the male and female quarters was supposed to be accomplished
by the erection of an iron railing
in this same prison
capital convicts were chained to the floor until execution
in another jail not far off
male and female felons still occupied the same room
underground and reached by a ladder of ten steps
in others the separation between the sexes consisted in a hanging curtain
or an imaginary boundary line
and nothing prevented parties from passing to either side
but an empty regulation which all so disposed could defy
numbers of the jails were still unprovided with chaplains
and the prisoners never heard divine service
in many others there were no infirmaries
no place is set apart for the confinement of prisoners afflicted with dangerous and infectious disorders
no attempt was made to maintain discipline
half the jails had no code of rules properly prepared and sanctioned by the judges according to law
by degrees however
the change is necessary to bring the prisons into conformity with the recent acts were attempted
if not actually introduced into the county prisons to which
with a few of the more important city or borrough prisons these acts more especially applied
most of the local authorities embarked into considerable expenditure
determined to rebuild their jails di novo
on the most approved pattern
or to reappropriate reconstruct and patch up the existing prisons till they were more in accordance with the growing requirements of the times
religious worship became more generally the rule
chaplains were appointed
and chapels provided for them
surgeons and hospitals also
workshops were built at many prisons various kinds of manufactures and trades were set on foot including weaving
matting
shoemaking and tailoring
the interior of one prison was illuminated throughout with gas still a novelty
which had been generally adopted in london only four years previously
a measure which must greatly tend to discourage attempts to escape
there were tread wheels at most of the prisons and regular employment thereon or at some other kind of hard labor
in many places too
where the prisoners earned money by their work
they were granted a portion of it for their own use after proper deduction for maintenance
only a few glaring evils still demanded a remedy
the provision of separate sleeping cells was still quite inadequate
for instance
in twenty two county jails there were one thousand sixty three sleeping cells in all in eighteen twenty three
and the average daily number committed that year amounted to three thousand nine hundred eighty five
the want of sleeping cells
long continued a crying need
four years later the present society reported
that in four prisons which at one time of the year contained one thousand three hundred eight prisoners there were only sixty eight sleeping rooms or cells
making an average of nineteen persons occupying each room
at the new prison clerkenwell
which had become the principal reception jail of middlesex and so took all the untried
the sleeping space her head was only sixteen inches
and often as many as two hundred ninety three men had to be accommodated on barrack beds
occupying barely three hundred ninety feet lineal
the scenes of tumult and obstenity in these night rooms are said to have been beyond description
a prisoner in one nocturnal riot lost in a eye
yet to clerkenwell were now committed the juveniles and all who were inexperienced in crime
great want of uniformity in treatment in the various prisons was still noticeable
and was indeed destined to continue for another half century in other words until the introduction of the prison act of eighteen seventy seven
at the time of which i am writing there was great diversity of practice as regards the hours of labor
in some prisons the prisoners worked seven hours a day
in others
ten and ten and a half
the nature of the employment varied greatly in severity especially the tread wheel labor
in some county jails as i have already said
female prisoners were placed upon the tread wheel
in others women were very properly exempted from it and also from all severe labor
burnings were very differently appropriated
here the prisoners were given the whole amount there a half or a third
sometimes this money might be expended in the purchase of extra articles of food
the rations varied considerably everywhere
it was still limited to bread in some places the allowance of which varied from one to three pounds
in others meat soup gruel beer were given
here and there food was not issued in kind but a money allowance which the prisoner might expend himself
bedding and clothing was still denied but only in a few jails
in others both were supplied in ample quantities the cost varying por prisoner from twenty shillings to five pounds
it was plain that although the law had defined general principles of prison government
too much discretion was still left to the magistracy to fill in the details the legislature only recommended
it did not peremptorily insist
too often the letter of the law was observed but not its spirit
one great impediment to wide amelioration was that a vast number of small jails lay out of reach of the law
when the new acts were introduced numerous prisons under local jurisdiction were exempted from the operation of the law
they were so radically bad that reform seemed hopeless
and it was thought wiser not to bring them under provisions which clearly could not be enforced
mister peele who as home secretary had charge of the bill
which became the four george the fourth cap sixty four said that he had abstained from legislating for these small jurisdictions on mature deliberation
it is not he said that i am insensible of the lamentable and disgraceful situation in which many of them are
but i indulge a hope that many of them will contract with the counties
that many of them will build new jails and that when in a year or two we come to examine their situation
we shall find but few which have not in one or other of these ways removed the grievance of which such just complaint is made
when that time arrives
i shall not hesitate to ask parliament for powers to compel them to make the necessary alterations for it is not to be endured that these local jurisdictions should remain
in the deplorable situation in which many of them now are
at this time there were in england one hundred and seventy burros cities towns and liberties
which possessed the right of trying criminals for various offences
nearly every one of these jurisdictions had its own prison and there were one hundred and sixty such jails in all
many of them consisted of one or two rooms at most
the total number of prisoners they received during the year varied from two persons too many hundreds
it was in these jails withdrawn from the pressure of authority that the new rules were invariably ignored
the right and privilege of the borough to maintain its own place of confinement was so ancient and indisputable
that for long no idea of interfering with them
was entertained
all that was urged was that the borough magistracy had no right to govern their jails
so as to corrupt those committed to the injury of the peace and morals of the public
as time passed however
these magistrates made no effort at reform
they neither built new jails nor contracted with the counties as had been expected
for the transfer of their prisoners
as the sosiety put it in eighteen twenty seven the friends to the improvement of prison discipline will regret to learn
that the jails attached to corporate jurisdictions continue to be the fruitful sources
of vice and misery
debasing all who are confined within their walls and disseminating through their respective communities
the knowledge and practice of every species of criminality
the society proceeded to support this indictment by facts it is much the old story
the prisoners were lodged in rooms whence they could converse with passengers in the streets and freely obtained spirits and other prohibited articles
all descriptions of offenders congregated together in the felon's wards
the keeper and his officers resided at a distance from the jail and left its inmates to their own devices
there was no decency whatever in the internal arrangements
still no separation of the sexes no means of ablution or other necessary services
one borrough prison consisted of nothing more than a couple of cells about ten yards square and absolutely nothing more
in another burrough with a population of ten thousand the prison was of the same dimensions
one cell was a dungeon
and the other
an improper and unhealthy abode for any human being with a watercourse running through it
most of these small jails were still in existence and in much the same state eighty years later
as is shown by the report of the commissioners to inquire into the state of the municipal corporations in eighteen thirty five
an examination of this report shows how even the most insignificant township had its jail
thus dinnis muda in marry anshire
had besides the pinfold and the stalks or crib
a little prison
kloon in shropshire had a lock up under the town hall
and i in suffolk the jail was part of the poorhouse so it was at richmond in yorkshire where the master of the workhouse was also keeper of the jail
at god manchester there was no jail but a cage to secure prisoners till they could be taken before a magistrate
kiter minster had a prison one damp chill room
the only aperture through which air could be admitted
being an iron grating level with the street
through the bars of which quills or reeds were inserted and drink conveyed to the prisoners
at walsall in staffordshire
the jail consisted of six cells frequently so damp that the moisture trickled down the walls
there was not space for air or exercise
and the prison allowance was still limited to bread and water
newgate through all these years continued a by word with the society
some reforms had certainly been introduced such as the abolition of irons already referred to and the establishment of male and female infirmaries
the regular daily visitation of the chaplain was also insisted upon
but it was pointed out in eighteen twenty three that defective construction must always bar the way to any radical improvement in newgate
without enlargement no material change in discipline or interior economy could possibly be introduced
the chapel still continued incommodious and insufficient
female prisoners were still exposed to the full view of the males the netting in front of the gallery being perfectly useless as a screen
in eighteen twenty four newgate had no glass in its windows except in the infirmary and one ward of the chapel yard
and the panes were filled in with oiled paper and insufficient protection against the weather
and as the window frames would not shut tight the prisoners complained much of the cold especially at night
there was a diminution in the numbers in custody due to the adoption of the practice of not committing at once to newgate every offender for trial at the old bailey
but nothing had been done to improve the prison buildings
in eighteen twenty seven the society was compelled to report that no material change had taken place in newgate since the passing of the prison laws
and that consequently the observance of their most important provisions was habitually neglected
it was enacted that the court of alderman should make rules for the government of the prison and that these should be posted publicly within the walls
as yet no rules or regulations had been printed or prepared
by another clause of the jail act two justices were to be appointed to visit the prison at least thrice in every quarter and oftener if occasion required
these justices were to inspect every part of the prison and examine into the state and condition of prisoners
the city justices had not fulfilled this obligation
idleness was still the general rule for all prisoners in newgate in defiance of the law
there was no instruction of adult prisoners in accordance with the law the sleeping accommodation was still altogether contrary to the latest ideas
the visits of friends was once more unreservedly allowed and these incomers freely brought in extra provisions and beer
last and worst of all the arrangements for keeping the condemned prisoners between sentence and execution were more than unsatisfactory
they were not confined apart from each other but were crowded thirty or forty together in the press yard
so that corrupt conversation obliterated from the mind of him who is doomed to suffer every serious feeling and valuable impression
i shall have more to say on this subject and upon the state of newgate generally in the following chapter
the present society did not relax its efforts as time passed but its leading members had other and more pressing claims upon their energies
mister buxton had succeeded to the great work which william wilberforce had commenced and led the repeated attacks upon slavery in british colonies
till the whole body of the slaves were manumitted in eighteen thirty three
in the year immediately preceding this parliament was too busy with the great question of its own reform to spare much time for domestic legislation
nevertheless a committee of the house of commons was appointed in eighteen thirty one to report upon the whole system of secondary punishments
which dealt with jails of all classes as well as transportation
this committee animadverted strongly upon the system in force at the metropolitan jails and more especially upon the condition of newgate
where prisoners before and after trial are under no efficient superintendence and where there was no restraint or attempt at restraint
mister samuel hore was examined by this committee
and stated that in his opinion newgate as the common jail of middlesex was wholly inadequate to the proper confinement of its prisoners
from the moment of a person's committal he was certain to be plunged deeper and deeper in guilt
the prisoners were crowded together in the jail contrary to the requirements of the four george the fourth
again in eighteen thirty five prisons and their inmates became once more the care of the senate and the subject was taken up this time by the house of lords
a committee was appointed under the presidency of the duke of richmond
to inquire into and report upon the several jails and houses of correction in the counties cities and corporate towns within england and wales
upon the rules and discipline therein established with regard to the treatment of unconvicted as well as convicted persons
the committee was also to report upon the manner in which sentences were carried out and to recommend any alterations necessary in the rules
in order to ensure uniformity of discipline it met on the thirty first march eighteen thirty five and continued its sittings well into july
during which time a host of witnesses were examined and the committee presented three separate reports
embodying recommendations which may be said to have formed the basis of modern prison management
it was laid down as a first and indispensable principle that uniformity of discipline should prevail everywhere
a theory which did not become a practical fact for forty more years
as a means of securing this uniformity
it was suggested that the rules framed for prison government should be subjected to the secretary of state for approval
and not as heretofore to the judges of a size that both to check abuses and watch the progress of improvement
inspectors of prison should be appointed who should visit all the prisons from time to time and report to the secretary of state
it was recommended that the dietaries should be submitted and approved like the rules that convicted prisoners should not receive any food but the jail allowance
that food and fuel should be issued in kind and never provided by the prisoners themselves out of moneys granted them
the use of tobacco hithertwo pretty generally indulged in both by men and women
should be strictly prohibited as a stimulating luxury inconsistent with any notion of strict discipline and the due pressure of just punishment
prison officers should not have any share in prisoners earnings
which should be paid into general prison funds and no part of them handed over to the prisoners themselves
as a means of increasing the severity of imprisonment letters and visits from outside should not be permitted during the first six months of an imprisonment
various other recommendations were made as regards the appointment of chaplain and schoolmasters the limitation of the powers of wardsmen
or prisoners employed in positions of trust who should not be permitted to traffic with their fellow prisoners in any way
the committee most of all insisted upon the entire individual separation of prisoners except during the hours of labor
religious worship and instruction as absolutely necessary for preventing contamination
and for securing a proper system of prison discipline
this was the first enunciation of the system of separate confinement
which was eventually to replace the attempted arrangement of prisoners by classes according to antecedents and crimes
an incomplete and fallacious method of preventing contamination
the lord's committee fully recognized the painful fact
that the greatest mischief followed from the intercourse which was still permitted in so many prisons to use its words
the comparatively innocent or seduced the unwary are entrapped
and the tendency to crime in offenders not entirely hardened is confirmed by the language the suggestions of the example
of more depraved and systematic criminals
this committee as well as the one preceding it also reported in terms of strong reprobation on the small prisons and jails
still under the borough corporations the commons committee gave it as their opinion that they were in a deplorable state
the same language was used by the commissioners appointed to inquire into the municipal corporations in eighteen thirty five
when speaking more particularly of the borough jails
in these the commissioners found additional proof of the evils of continuing the present constitution of the local tribunals
instances rarely occur in which the borough jails admit of any proper classification of the prisoners
in some large towns as at berwick on tweed southampton and southwark they the prisons are in a very discreditable condition
in many of the smaller boroughs they are totally unfit for the confinement of human beings
in these places the prisoners are often without a proper supply of air and light frequently the jails are mere dungeons under the town hall
it was frequently stated in evidence that the jail of the borough was in so unfit a state for the reception of prisoners
that plaintiffs were unwilling to consign the defendants against whom they had obtained execution to confinement within its walls
the lords committee on jails were of the same opinion and considered the prisons under corporate or peculiar jurisdiction in a very unsatisfactory condition
they therefore recommended that the prisoners should be removed
to the county jails from such prisons as were past improvement
and that the borough funds should be charged for the accommodation
the whole question was again dealt with in lord john russell's bill
for the reform of the municipal corporations and with a more liberal election of town councillors
and the establishment of municipal institutions upon a proper footing
the chronicles of newgate volume two by arthur griffith's section nine the first report of the inspector of prisons
in the preceding chapter i have been tempted by the importance of the general question to give it prominence and precedence over the particular branch of which i am treating
newgate has remained rather in the background while the whole of the jails as a body were under discussion
but this digression was necessary in order to present a more complete picture of the state of jails in the early part of the present century
just before the public mind was first awakened to the need for thorough reform
i shall now return to the great jail of the city of london and give a more detailed account of its condition and inner life
as the inspectors of prisons found them in eighteen thirty five two six
these gentlemen were appointed in october eighteen thirty five owing to the strong representations of the lord's committee
backed up by the evidence of several influential witnesses
mister samuel hoe when examined considered it indispensably necessary to carry out whatever system might be established
that inspectors should watch over the observance of the law he saw no objection on the score of their probable interference with the local jurisdiction
but he would not arm them with any authority lest their co operation might be offensive
sir frederick roe was of the same opinion as regards the appointment but he would give the inspectors the power of acting as well as reporting
they should be persons he thought selected from the highest class the duty was most important
one which required discretion judgment and knowledge of law with sufficient insight and experience to discover defects in prison discipline
these considerations no doubt had weight
with those who made the selection of the first inspectors and the two gentlemen appointed were probably the most fitted in england to be so employed
one was mister william crawford the other the reverend whitworth russell
the first named had long been an active philanthropist devoting himself more particularly to the reformation of juvenile criminals
william crawford had been one of the promoters and managers of the philanthropic societies farm school
later on he had devoted himself to the personal investigation of the prisons of the united states
at that time the mild and intelligent prison discipline in force in pennsylvania the legacy of the old quaker immigrants
had made such prisons as auburn a model for imitation
several european states had dispatched emissaries to examine and report upon them
france had sent messrs beaumont and ditopville who subsequently published several interesting works on the subject
england was represented by mister crawford and the result of his inquiry was given to the public as an appendix to the house of commons report on secondary punishments
it is an able and exhaustive state paper testifying to the keenness of the writer's perception and his unremitting labor in pursuing his researches
mister crawford was thoroughly versed in the still imperfectly understood science of prison management and fully qualified for his new duties
the second inspector the reverend whitworth russell was the chaplain of millbank penitentiary
the great architectural experiment which grew out of the strong representations of jeremy bentam and others and was the first national recognition of the principle
that punishment must be reformatory as well as deterrent
messrs crawford and russell proceeded to carry out their new functions with commendable energy and without a moment's loss of time
the ink was barely dry upon their letters of appointment before they appeared at newgate and commenced a searching investigation
they attended early and late they mustered the prisoners examined into their condition
took the luminous evidence from all classes of individuals from the governor down to the convict in the condemned cells
they visited the wards after locking up time and saw with their own eyes what went on
a subject of magnitude and importance sufficient to exclude other jails they soon narrowed their inquiries still further
and limited it to newgate alone newgate indeed became the sole theme of their first report
the fact was that the years as they passed nearly twenty in all had worked but little permanent improvement in this detestable prison
changes introduced under pressure had been only skin deep
relapse was rapid and inevitable so that the latter state of the prison was worse than the first
the disgraceful overcrowding had been partially ended but the same evils of indiscriminate association were still present there was the old neglect of decency
the same callous indifference to the moral well being of the prisoners the same want of employment and of all disciplinary control
all these evils were set forth at length in the inspector's first report
there was no longer the faintest possible excuse for overcrowding the numbers now committed ton newgate had sensibly diminished
the prison had become more or less a place of detention only harbouring mainly those awaiting trial
to these were still added an average of about fifty expecting the last penalty of the law a certain number of transports awaiting removal to the colonies
an occasional prisoner or two committed by the houses of parliament the courts of king's bench common please
the exchequer be commissioners of bankruptcy and of taxes smugglers and a larger number sentenced for very short terms
and for offenses of the most varying description by the central criminal court
the sum total thus produced was inconsiderable compared with the hundreds that had formerly filled the jail
and the whole by proper management might have been so accommodated as to prevent overcrowding
but incredible as it may appear the authorities of newgate declined to avail themselves of the advantages offered them
and when the population fell they shut up one half the jail and crowded up the other
some rooms remained quite empty and unoccupied while others were full to overflowing
not only were the wards thus needlessly crammed and for no reason but the niggardliness of the corporation which refused a proper supply of bidding
but the occupants of each were huddled together indiscriminately the inspectors found in the same wards in the chapel yard the convicted and the untried
the felon and the misdemeanourt the sane and the insane the old and the young fender
the classification prescribed by the jail act which laid down that certain prisoners should not intermix was openly neglected
and the greatest contempt shown for the law
in another part there were men charged with and convicted of unnatural offences shut up with lads of tender years
minor offenders charged with small thefts or non payment of small sums were cheek by jowl with convicts sentenced to long terms of transportation
in the master's side yard which had only one washing place as many as seventy eight prisoners frequently more
were associated together of every variety of age habit and delinquency without employment over sight or control
in the middle yard it was still worse
here say the inspectors are herded together the very worst class of prisoners certainly a more wretched combination of human beings can hardly be imagined
we have reason to fear that poverty ragged clothes and an inability to pay the war dues elsewhere exacted for better accommodation
consign many of the more petty and unpractised offenders to this place
where they inevitably meet with further contamination from the society of the most abandoned and incorrigible inmates of the jail
no doubt the governor for the time being mister cope was in a great measure to blame for all this and for the want of proper classification
i shall have occasion to speak again and more at length of mister cope's careless and perfunctory discharge
of his many manifest duties but i shall here confine myself to animadverting on his neglect as regards the appropriation of his prison
he was unable to give any reason whatever for not utilizing the whole of the wards
he saw certain rooms fill up and yet took no steps to open others that were locked up and empty
he blamed the construction of newgate for the neglect of classification and was yet compelled to confess that he had made no attempt whatever to carry it out
the fact was he did not keep the classification of prisoners on first arrival in his own hands nor even in that of his officers
a new prisoner's fate as to location rested really with a powerful fellow prisoner
the inspectors found that prisoners had their places assigned to them
by the inner gatesman himself a convicted prisoner and a wardsman or responsible head of a room
the wardsmen still exacted dews of which more directly
and this particular official took excellent care to select as residence for his own ward those most suitable from his own point of view
so great is the authority exercised by him
and so numerous were his opportunities of showing favoritism that all the prisoners may be said to be in his power
if a man is poor and ragged however inexperienced in crime or however trifling may be the offence for which he has been committed
his place is a sign among the most depraved the most experienced and the most incorrigible offenders in the middle yard
it must be admitted that so far but little effort had been made to counteract the evils of indiscriminate association
it was not likely that a system which left innocent men for the great bulk of new arrivals were still untried
to be pitchfork by chance anywhere into any sort of company
within this the greatest nursery of crime in london should exercise even the commonest care for the personal decency or comfort of the prisoners
their treatment was also a matter of chance they still slept on rope mats on the floor herded together in companies of four or more to keep one another warm
and under the scanty covering of a couple of dirty stable rugs apiece
so closely did they lie together that the inspectors at their night visits found it difficult in stepping across the room to avoid treading on them
sometimes two mats were allotted to three sleepers sometimes four slept under the same bedding and left their mats unoccupied
the rugs used were never washed an order existed that the bedding should be taken into the yards to be aired but it was not very punctually obeyed
the only convenience for personal ablutions were the pumps in the yards and the far off baths in the condemned or press yard
water might not be taken into the ward for washing purposes
there was some provision of clothing but it was quite insufficient and nothing at all was given if prisoners had enough of their own to cover their nakedness
the inspectors paraded the prisoners and found them generally ragged and ill clad squalid and filthy in the extreme
many without stockings and with hardly shoes to their feet
some who had the semblance of covering on the upper part of their feet had no souls to the shoes and their bare feet were on the ground
this too was in the depth of the winter and during a most inclement season
the allowance of food was not illiberal
but its issue was precarious and dependent on the good will of the wardsmen who measured out the portions to each according to his eye
and not with weights and measures no turnkey being present
too much was left to the wardsman it was he who could issue small luxuries
he sold tea coffee sugar tobacco although prohibited and extra beer
he charged a weekly sum as war dews for the use of knives forks and plates
a perpetuation under another form of the old detestable custom of garnish
he had power where his exactions were resisted of making the ward most uncomfortable for the defaulter
he could trump up a false complaint against his fellow prisoner and so get him punished
he might keep him from the fire or give him his soup or gruel in a pail instead of a basin
the authority of these wardsmen so improperly exalted and so entirely unchecked degenerated into a baneful despotism
they bought their offices from one another and were thus considered to have a vested interest in them
their original capital had been a few shillings and for this they purchased the right to tax their fellows to the extent of pounds per week
the wardsmen had a monopoly in supplying provisions gave dinner and breakfast at his own price and with such complete master of the ward
that none of its inmates were suffered to make tea or coffee for themselves lest it should interfere with his sails
he made collections when it suited him for ward purposes to be spent as he chose in candles and so forth
when the wardsman was a man of some education with some knowledge of legal chicanery gained by personal experience he might add considerably to his emoluments
by drawing briefs and petitions for his fellows there was a recognized charge of five shillings per brief
for a petition of from one shilling halfpence to eight shillings according to its length
and by these payments a wordsman had been known to a mass as much as forty pounds
the man intrusted with this privilege was often the inner gatesman
the prisoner official already mentioned who held the fate of new arrivals as regards location in his hands
it was not strange that he should sometimes misuse his power and when prisoners were not to be cajoled into securing his legal services
had been known to employ threats declaring that he was often consulted by the governor as to a prisoner's character
in view of speaking to it at the trial and he could easily do them a good turn or a very bad one
the brief drawing gatesmen and wardsmen at the time of the inspector's first visit must have been a particularly powerful personage
he was on the most intimate and improperly familiar terms with the turnkeys
had a key of both the master's side and middle side yards was the only person present at the distribution of beer and was trusted to examine
and if he chose pass in all provisions money clothes and letters brought for prisoners by their friends
all the wordsmen alike were more or less irresponsible
the turnkeys complained bitterly that these old prisoners had more power than they themselves
the governor himself admitted that a prisoner of weak intellect who had been severely beaten and much injured by a wardsman did not dare complain
the victim of this cruel ill usage having more fear of the power of the wardsman to injure him than confidence in the governor's power to protect him
these wardsmen besides thus ruling the roast had numerous special privileges if such they can be called
they were not obliged to attend chapel and seldom if ever wet
prisoners said one of them under examination did not like the trouble of going to chapel
they had a standing bedstead to sleep on and a good flock mattress double allowance of provisions filched from the common stock
nobody interfered with them or regulated their conduct
they might get drunk when so disposed and did so frequently alone or in company
evidence was given before the inspectors of eight or ten prisoners seen giddy drunk not able to sit upon forms
the female wards women were also given to intemperance
the matron depposed to having seen the gateswoman exceedingly drunk and having been insulted by her
there was no penalty attached to drunkenness
a wardsman did not necessarily lose his situation for it nor was drink the only creature comfort he might enjoy
he could indulge in snuff if a snuff taker
and might always smoke his pipe undisturbed for although the use of tobacco had been prohibited since the report of the lord's committee
it was still freely introduced into the prison
probably authority would not have been so recklessly usurped by the wardsmen had not the proper officials too readily surrendered it
the turnkeys left the prisoners very much to themselves never entering the wards after locking up time at dusk till unlocking next morning
and then only went round to count the number
many of them were otherwise and improperly occupied for hours every day in menial services for the governor cleaning his windows or grooming his horse
one turn key had been so employed several hours daily for nearly eleven years
it was not strange that subordinates should neglect their duty when superiors set the example
nothing was more prominently brought out by the inspectors than the inefficiency of the governor at that time mister cope
he may have erred in some points through ignorance but in others he was clearly guilty of culpable neglect
we have seen that he took no pains to classify and separate prisoners on reception
this was only one of many grave omissions on his part he did not feel it incumbent on himself to visit his prison often or see his prisoners
the act prescribed that he should do both every twenty four hours but days passed without his entering the wards
the prisoners declared that they did not see him oftener than twice a week
one man who had been in the condemned ward for two months said the governor only came there four times
again a turnkey deposed that his chief did not enter the wards more than once a fortnight
but it is only fair to mister cope to state that he himself said he went whenever he could find time
and that he was constantly engaged attending sessions and going with draufhts to the hulks
but when he did visit his inspections were of the most superficial character
sometimes he looked at his bolts and bars but he never examined the cupboards coal boxes or other possible hiding places for cards
dice dangerous implements or other prohibited articles
he only attended chapel once on sunday never on the week day and generally devoted the time service was in progress
to taking the descriptions of newly arrived prisoners
he really did not know what passed in his jail
and was surprised when the inspectors proved to him that practices of which he was ignorant and which he admitted that he reprehended went on without hindrance
he was satisfied to let matters run on as in the old times he said in his own justification with him what was was right
and evils that should have been speedily rooted out remained because they had the prescription of long usage
he kept no daily journal of occurrences and nothing however important was recorded at the time
the alder men never called upon him to report and left him nearly unsupervised and uncontrolled
in his administration of discipline he was quite uncertain
the punishments he inflicted were unequal
and it was not the least part of the blame imputed to him that he made special favourites of particular prisoners retaining of his own accord in newgate
and for years falons who should have been sent beyond the seas
but indeed his whole rule was far too mild
and under this mistaken leniency
the interior of the jail was more like a beargarden or the noisy purlieus of a public house than a prison
it was the same old story evil constantly in the ascendant the least criminal at the mercy of the most depraved
under the reckless contempt for regulations
the apathy of the authorities and the undue ascendancy of those who as convicted felons should have been most sternly repressed
the most hardened and the oldest in vice had the best of it while the inexperienced beginner went to the wall
edward gibbon wakefield who spent three years in newgate a little before the time of the inspector's first report
said with justice that incredible scenes of horror occur in newgate
it was moreover in his opinion undoubtedly the greatest nursery of crime in london
the days were passed in idleness debauchery riotous quarrelling immoral conversation
gambling indirect contravention of parliamentary rules instruction in all nefarious processes
lively discourse upon past criminal exploits elaborate discussion of others to be perpetrated after release
no provision whatever was made for the employment of prisoners no materials were purchased no trade instructors appointed
there was no school for adults only the boys were taught anything and their instructor with his assistant were convicted prisoners
idle hands and unoccupied brains found in mischief the only means of whiling away the long hours of incarceration
gaming of all kinds although forbidden by the jail acts was habitually practised
this was admitted in evidence by the turnkeys and was proved by the appearance of the prison tables which bore the marks of gaming boards deeply cut into them
prisoners confessed that it was a favorite occupation the chief games being shoving halfpence on the table
pitch in the whole cribbage dominoes and common tossing at which as much as four or five shillings would change hands in an hour
but this was not the only amusement
most of the wards took in the daily papers
the most popular being betimes mourning harold and morning chronicle on sunday the weekly dispatch bell's life and the weekly messenger
the newsman had free access to the prison he passed in unsearched and unexamined and unaccompanied by an officer
went at once to his customers who bought their paper and paid for it themselves
the news vendor was also a tobacconist
and he had thus ample means of introducing to the prisoners bhe prohibited but always much coveted and generally procurable weed
in the same way the wardsman laid in his stock to be retailed other lihe literature besides the daily journals were in circulation
novels flash songs play books such as jane shore grimm's german tails with qrickshanks illustrations
and publications which in these days would have been made the subject of a criminal prosecution
one of these published by stockdale the inspector styled a book of the most disgusting nature
there was also a good supply of bibles and prayers
the donation of a philanthropic gentleman captain brown but these particularly the bibles bore little appearance of having been used
drink in more or less unlimited quantities was still to be had
spirits certainly were now excluded but a potman with full permission of the sheriffs
brought in beer for sale from a neighboring public house and visited all the wards with no other escort than the prisoner gatesman
the quantity to be issued per head was limited by the prison regulations to one pint
but no steps were taken to prevent any prisoner from obtaining more if he could pay for it
the beer men brought in as much as he pleased he sold it without the controlling presence of an officer
not only did prisoners come again and again for a pint but large quantities were carried off to the wards to be drunk later in the day
they were more varied and at times
especially when beer had circulated freely more uproarious diversions
wrestling in which legs were occasionally broken was freely indulged in
also such low games as cobbum
leap frog puss in the corner and fly the garter for which purpose the rugs were spread out to prevent feet slipping on the floor
feasting alternated with fighting
the weekly introduction of food to which i shall presently refer formed the basis of luxurious banquets washed down by liquor
and enlivened by flash songs and thrilling long winded descriptions of robberies and other plants
there was much swearing and bad language the very worst that could be used from the first thing in the morning to the last thing at night
new arrivals especially the innocent and still guileless debutante were tormented with a rude horse play and assailed by the most insulting chaff
if any man presumed to turn in too early
he was toad that is to say a string was fastened to his big toe while he was asleep and he was dragged from off his met
or his bedclothes were drawn away across the room
the ragged part of the prisoners were very anxious to destroy the clothes of the better dressed and often lighted small pieces of cloth
which they dropped smouldering into their fellow prisoners pockets
often the victim goaded to madness attacked his tormentors a fight was then certain to follow
these fights sometimes took place in the daytime when a ring was regularly formed and two or three stood by the door to watch for the officer's approach
more often they occurred at night and were continued to the bitter end
the prisoners in this way administered serious punishment on one another black eyes and broken noses were always to be seen
more cruel injuries were common enough which did not result from honest hand to hand fights
the surgeon's journal produced to the inspectors contained numerous entries of terrible wounds inflicted in a cowardly way
a serious accident one of the prisoners had a hot poker run into his eye
a lad named matthew white has had a wound in his eye by a bone thrown at him which very nearly destroyed vision
there was a disturbance in the transport yard yesterday evening and the police were called in
during the tumult a prisoner who was one of the worst of the riters was bruised about the head and body
watkins is knee joint is very severely injured
a prisoner baxter is in the infirmary in consequence of a severe injury to his wrist joints
watkin's case referred to above is made the subject of another and a special report from the surgeon
he was in the transport side when one of his fellows in endeavoring to strike another prisoner with a large poker missed his aim and struck watkin's knee
violent inflammation and extensive separation ensued and for a considerable time amputation seemed inevitable
after severe suffering prolonged for many months the inflammation was subdued but the cartilage of the neejoint was destroyed and he was crippled for life
on another occasion a young man who was being violently teased seized a knife and stabbed his tormentor in the back
the prisoner who used the knife was secured
but it was the wardsman and not the officers to whom the report was made and no official inquiry or punishment followed
matters were at times still worse and the rioting went on to such dangerous lengths as to endanger the safety of the building
on one occasion a disturbance was raised which was not quelled until windows had been broken and forms and tables burnt
the officers were obliged to go in among the prisoners to restore order with drawn cutlasses
but the presence and authority of the governor himself became indispensable
the worst fights occurred on sunday afternoons but nearly every night the act of locking up became from the consequent removal of all supervision
the signal for the commencement of obscene talk revelry and violence
all the regulations laid down by the jail acts were still defied one of these was that prisoners should be restricted to the jail allowance of food
but all could still obtain as much extra and of a luxurious kind as their friends chose to bring them in
visitors were still permitted to come with supplies on given days of the week about the only limitation being that the food should be cutd and cold
hot meat poultry and fish were also forbidden
but the inspectors found in the ward cupboards mince pies and other pasties cold joints hams and so forth
many other articles were introduced by visitors including money tobacco pipes and snuff
from the same source came the two or three strong files which the inspectors found in one ward
together with four bradles several large iron spikes screws nails and knives
all of them instruments calculated to facilitate attempts at breaking out of prison
and capable of becoming most dangerous weapons in the hands of desperate and determined men
the nearly indiscriminate admission of visitors although restricted to certain days continued to be an unmixed evil
the untried might see their friends three times a week the convicted only once
on these occasions precautions were supposed to be taken to exclude bad characters
yet many persons of notoriously loose life continually obtained egress
women saw men if they merely pretended to be wives even boys were visited by their sweethearts
decency was however insured by a line of demarcation and visitors were kept upon each side of a separated double iron railing
but no search was made to intercept prohibited articles at the gate and there was no permanent gatekeeper
which would have greatly helped to keep out bad characters some idea of the difficulty and inconvenience of these lax regulations as regards visiting
may be gathered from the statement that as many as three hundred were often admitted on the same day
enough to altogether upset what small show of decorum and discipline was still preserved in the prison
perhaps the worst feature of the visiting system was the permission accorded to male prisoners under the name of husbands brothers and sons
to have access to the female side on sundays and wednesdays in order to visit their supposed relations there
on this female side where the ladies association still reigned supreme more system and a greater semblance of decorum was maintained
but there were evils akin to those on the mail side prominent amongst which was the undue influence accorded to prisoners
a female prisoner kept the registers
wards women were allowed much the same authority with the same temptations to excess and intoxication was not unknown among them and others
the clothing was still meagr and ragged the washing place is insufficient and wanting indecency
in some yards
the pump was the only provision
and this in a place within sight of visitors of the windows of the male turnkeys and unprotected from the weather
there was the same crowding in the sleeping arrangements as on the male side the same scarcity of bedding
it was a special evil of this part of the prison that the devotional exercises originally so profitable had grown into a kind of edifying spectacle
which numbers of well meaning but inquisitive people were anxious to witness
thus when the inspectors visited there were twenty three strangers and only twenty eight prisoners
the presence of so many strangers many of them gentlemen
distracted the prisoner's attention and could not be productive of much good
the separation of the sexes was not indeed rigidly carried out in newgate as yet
we have seen that male prisoners visited their female relations and friends on the female side besides this
the gatesmen who prepared the briefs had interviews with female prisoners alone while taking their instructions a female came alone and unaccompanied by a matron
to clean the governor's office in the male prison
male prisoners carried coal into the female prison when they saw and could speak or pass letters to the female prisoners
and the men could also at any time go for tea coffee and sugar to missus brown's shop which was inside the female gate
in the bale doc where most improper general association was permitted the female prisoners were often altogether in the charge of male turnkeys
the governor was also personally responsible for gross contravention of this rule of separation
and was in the habit of drawing frequently upon the female prison for prisoners to act as domestic servants in his own private dwelling
some member of the ladies association observed and commented upon the fact that a young rosy cheeked girl had been kept by the governor from transportation
while older women in infirm health were sent across the seas
his excuse was that he had given the girl his promise that she should not go an assumption of prerogative which by no means rested with him
but he afterwards admitted that the girl had been recommended to him by the principal turnkey who knew something of her friends
this woman was really his servant employed to help in cleaning and taken on whenever there was extra work to be done
the governor had a great dislike he said to seeing strangers in his house
this girl had been first engaged on account of the extra work entailed by certain prisoners
committed by the house of commons who had been lodged in the governor's own house
the house at this time was full of men and visitors waiters came in from the taverns with meals
some of the prisoners had their valets and all these were constantly in and out of the kitchen where this female prisoner was employed
there was revelling and roystering as usual with high life below stairs
the governor sent down wine on festive occasions of which no doubt the prisoner housemaid had for share
the chronicles of newgate volume two by arthur griffith's section ten the first report of the inspector of prisons
eighteen years had elapsed since the formation of the lady's association
and missus fry with her colleagues still labored assiduously in newgate devoting themselves mainly to the female prison
although their ministrations were occasionally extended to the mail side
the inspectors paid tribute to the excellence of the motives of these philanthropic ladies and recognized the good they did
they had introduced much order and cleanliness
had provided work for those who had hitherto passed their time in total idleness and had made the treatment of female transports on the way to new south wales
there especial care
they had tried moreover
by their presence and their pious disinterested efforts to restrain the dissolute manners and vicious language of the unhappy and depraved inmates
but it was already plain that they constituted an independent authority within the jails they were frequently in conflict with the chaplain
who not strangely resented the orders issued by the aldermen
that women should be frequently kept from chapel in order that they might attend the ladies lectures and exhortations
the admission of a crowd of visitors to assist in these lay services has already been remarked upon as the inspectors pointed out
it had the bad effect of distracting attention
it tended to dissipate reflection diminish the gloom of the prison and mitigate the punishment which the law has sentenced the prisoner to undergo
it is to be feared too that although the surface was thus whitewashed and decorous much that was vicious still festered and rankled beneath
and that when the restraining influences of the ladies were absent the female prisoners relapsed into immoral and uncleanly discourse
even in the daytime when supervision was withdrawn the language used to be dreadful says one of the women whent under examination
swearing and talking of what crimes they had committed and how they had done it another witness declared she had heard the most shocking language in the yard she said
she had never witnessed such scenes before and hopes she never shall again it was dreadful
after locking up time which varied as on the male side according to the daylight the scenes were often riotous and disgraceful
the poor who could afford no luxuries went to bed early but were kept awake by the revelries of the rich
who supped royally on the supplies provided from outside and kept it up till ten or eleven o'clock
there were frequent quarrels and fights shoes and other missiles were freely bandied about
and with all this the most dreadful oaths the worst language too bad to be repeated were made use of every night
bad as were the various parts of the jail already dealt with
there still remained one where the general callous indifference and mismanagement culminated in cruel culpable neglect
the condition of the capitally convicted prisoners after sentence was still very disgraceful the side they occupied still known as the press yard
consisted of two dozen rooms and fifteen cells in these various chambers until just before the inspectors made their report
all classes of the condemned those certain to suffer and the larger number who were nearly certain of a reprieve
were jumbled up together higglely pegglety the old and the young
the murderer and the child who had broken into a dwelling
all privacy was impossible under the circumstances
at times the numbers congregated together were very great as many as fifty and sixty even more were crowded indiscriminately into the press yard
the better disposed complain bitterly of what they had to endure
one man declared that the language of the condemned rooms was disgusting that he was dying at death every day in being compelled to associate with such characters
in the midst of the noisy and blasphemous talk no one could pursue his meditations any who tried to pray became the sport and ridicule of his brutal fellows
owing to the repeated entreaties of the criminals who could hardly hope to escape the gallows some show of classification was carried out
and when the inspectors visited newgate they found the three certain to die in a day room by themselves
in a second room or fourteen more who had every hope of a reprieve
the whole of these seventeen had however a common erring yard and took their exercise there at the same time
so that men in the most awful situation daily expecting to be hanged
were associated continually with a number of those who could look with certainty on a mitigation of punishment
the latter light hearted and reckless conducted themselves in the most unseemly fashion and with as much indifference as the inmates of the other parts of the prison
they amused themselves after their own fashion played all day long at blind man's buff and leap frog or beat each other with a knotted handkerchief
laughing and uproarious utterly unmindful of the companionship of men upon whom lay the shadow of an impending shameful death
men whose cases were dangerous and those most seriously inclined complained of these annoyances
so subversive of meditation so disturbing to the thoughts
they suffered sickening anxiety and wished to be locked up alone this indiscriminate association lasted for months
during the whole of which time the unhappy convicts who had but little hope of commutation were exposed to the mockery of their reckless associates
the brutal callousness of the bulk of the inmates of the press yard may be gathered from the prison punishment book which frequently recorded such entries as the following
benjamin vines and daniel ward put in irons for two days for breaking the windows of the day room in the condemned cells
joseph coleman put in irons for three days for striking one of the prisoners in the same place
there were disputes and quarrels constantly among these doomed men
it was a word and blow an argument clenched always with a fight
the more peaceably disposed found some occupation in making newgate tokens
leaden hearts and grinding the impressions off penny pieces then pricking figures or words on them to give to their friends as memorials
turnkeys occasionally visited the press yard but its occupants were under little or no control
the chaplain who might have been expected to make these men his peculiar care and who at one time had visited them frequently off and several times a week
had relaxed his efforts because according to his own account he was so frequently stopped in the performance of his duties
in his evidence before the inspectors he declared that for years he gave his whole time to his duties from an early hour in the morning till late in the afternoon
he left off because he was so much interfered with and laughed at and from seeing that no success attended his efforts owing to the evils arising from association
latterly his ministrations to the condemned had been restricted to a visit on sunday afternoons and occasionally about once a fortnight on a week day
itis only fair to mister cotton to add that according to his own journal he was unremitting in his attentions to convicts who were actually cast for death
and the day of whose execution was fixed he had no doubt a difficult mission to discharge
on the one hand the lady's association supported and encouraged by public approval trenched upon his peculiar province
on the other the governor of the jail sneered at his zeal
stigmatized his often most just strictures on abuses as a bundle of nonsense and the alder man when he appealed to them for protection and countenance
generally sided with his opponents nevertheless the inspectors summed up against him
while admitting that he had had many difficulties to contend with
and that he had again and again protested against the obstacles thrown in his way the inspectors cannot forbear expressing their opinion that he might have shown greater perseverance
in the face of impediments confessedly discouraging
as regards the private teaching of prisoners and they went on to say that a resolved adherence in spite of discouragements the most disheartening
to that line of conduct which his duty imposed on him
would it is probable have eventually overcome the reluctance of some of the prisoners at least and would have possessed so much moral dignity
as effectually to rebuke and abash the profane spirit of the more insolent and daring of the criminals
the lax discipline maintained in newgate was still further deteriorated by the presence of two other classes of prisoners who ought never to have been inmates of such a jail
one of these were the criminal lunatics who were at this time and for long previous continuously imprisoned there
as the law stood since the passing of the ninth george the fourth sea forty any two justices might remove a prisoner found to be insane either on commitment
or arraignment to an asylum and the secretary of state had the same power as regards any who became insane while undergoing sentence
these powers were not invariably put in force and there were in consequence many unhappy lunatics in newgate and other jails
whose proper place was the asylum
at the time the lord's committee sat there were eight thus retained in newgate and to return in the appendix of the lord's report
gives a total of thirty nine lunatics confined in various jails many of them guilty of murder and other serious crimes
the inspectors in the following year on examining the facts found that some of these poor creatures had been in confinement for long periods
at newgate and york castle as long as five years at ilchester and morpith for seven years at warwick for eight years
at buckingham and hereford for eleven years
at appleby for thirteen years at angle sea for fifteen years at exeter for sixteen years and at pembroke
for not less a period than twenty four years
it was manifestly wrongd that such persons visited by the most awful of calamities should be detained in a common prison
not only did their presence tend greatly to interfere with the discipline of the prison but their condition was deplorable in the extreme
the lunatic became the sport of the idle and the depraved his cure was out of the question
he was placed in a situation beyond all others calculated to confirm his malady and prolong his sufferings
the matter was still further complicated at newgate by the presence within the walls of sham lunatics some of those included in the category
had actually been returned as sayine from the asylum to which they had been sent and there was always some uncertainty as to who was mad and who not
prisoners indeed were known to boast that they had saved their necks by feigning insanity
it was high time that the unsatisfactory state of the law as regards the treatment of criminal lunatics should be remedied
and not the least of the good services rendered by the new inspectors was their inquiry into the status of these unfortunate people and their recommendation to improve it
the other inmates of the prison of an exceptional character and exempted from the regular discipline such as it was
were the ten persons committed to newgate by the house of commons in eighteen thirty five
these were the gentlemen concerned in the bribery case at ipswitch in eighteen thirty five
when a petition was presented against the return of messrs adam dundas and fitzroy kelly various witnesses including messrs j b dascent
pilgrim bond and clamp had refused to give evidence before the house of commons committee a speaker's warrant was issued for their arrest when they absconded
mister j e sparrow and mister clipperton
the parliamentary agents of the members whose election was impugned were implicated in aiding and abetting the others to abscond and a mister o'malley
counsel for the two m p s was also concerned
pilgrim and dasint were caught and given into the custody of the sergeant at arms
and the rest were either arrested or they surrendered
a resolution at once passed the house without division to commit the whole to newgate where they remained for various terms
dasant and pilgrim were released in ten days on making due submission
oe malley sent in a medical certificate declaring that the imprisonment was endangering his life and after some question he was also released
the rest were detained for more than a month it being considered that they were the most guilty as being either professional agents who advised the others to abscond
or witnesses who did not voluntarily come forward when the chance was given them
many of the old customs once prevalent in the states side so properly condemned and abolished
were revived for the convenience of these gentlemen whose incarceration was thus rendered as little like imprisonment as possible
a certain number who could afford the high rate of a guinea per dim fixed by the under sheriff were lodged in the governor's house
slept there and had their meals provided for them from the sessions house or london coffee house
a few others who could not afford a payment of more than half a guinea were permitted to monopolize a part of the prisond infirmary
where the upper ward was exclusively appropriated to their use they also had their meals sent in and with the food
wine almost at libertum
a prisoner one of the wardsmen waited on those in the infirmary
the occupants of the governor's house had their own servants or the governors
as a rule
visitors many of them persons of good position
came and went all day long
and as late as nine at night
some to the infirmary many more to the governor's house
there were no restraints cards and backgammon were played and the time passed in feasting and revelry
even mister cope admitted that the committal of this class of prisoners to newgate was most inconvenient
and the inspectors expressed themselves still more strongly in reprehension of the practice
the infirmary at this particular period epitomize the condition of the jail at large
it was diverted from its proper uses and as the place of the greatest comfort was allotted to persons who should not have been sent to newgate at all
all the evils of indiscriminate association were strongly accentuated by the crowd collected within its narrow limits
it may easily be imagined say the inspectors in speaking of the prison generally
what must be the state of discipline in a place filled with characters so various as were assembled there where the tried and the untried the sick and the healthy
the sane and the insane the young and the old the trivial offender and the man about to suffer the extreme penalty of the law
are all huddled together without discrimination over sight or control
enough has probably been extracted from this most damnatory report to give a complete picture of the disgraceful state in which newgates still remained in eighteen thirty five
the inspectors however honestly admitted that although the sight of the prison was convenient its construction was as bad as bad could be
valuable space was cumbered with many long and winding passages numerous staircases and unnecessarily thick and cumbrous inner walls
the wards were in some cases spacious but they were entirely unsuited for separation or the inspection of prisoners
the yards were narrow and confined mainly because the ground plan was radically vicious these were evils inseparable from the place
but there were others remediable under a better system of management
more attention to ventilation which was altogether neglected and inadequate would have secured a better atmosphere for the unhappy inmates
who constantly breathed an air heavy and when the wards were first opened in the morning particularly offensive
again the discipline commonly deemed inseparable from every place of durance was entirely wanting
the primary object of committing a prisoner to jail as the inspectors pointed out was to deterne not only the criminal himself but others from crime
and to dispose him by meditation and seclusion to return to an honest life
but at newgate the convicted prisoner instead of privation and hard fare
is permitted to purchase whatever his own means or the means of his friends in or out of prison can afford
and he can almost invariably procure the luxuries of his class of life beer and tobacco in abundance
instead of seclusion and meditation his time is passed in the midst of a body of criminals of every class and degree in riot debauchery and gaming
vaunting his own adventures or listening to those of others
communicating his own skill and aptitude in crime or acquiring the lessons of greater adepts he has access to newspapers and of course
prefers that description which are expressly prepared for his own class and which abound in vulgar adventure in criminal enterprise and in the histories of the police
the jail and the scaffold
he is allowed intercourse with prostitutes who in nine cases out of ten have originally conduced to his ruin
and his connection with them is confirmed by that devotion and generosity towards their paramours in adversity for which these otherwise degraded women are remarkable
having thus passed his time he returns a greater adept in crime with a wider acquaintance among criminals and what perhaps is even more injurious to him
is generally known to all the worst men in the country not only without the inclination but almost without the ability of returning to an honest life
these pungent and well grounded strictures applied with still greater force to the unconvicted prisoner the man who came to the prison innocent and still uncontaminated
to be subjected to the same baneful influences and to suffer the same moral deterioration whether ultimately convicted or set free
the whole system or more correctly the want of system was baneful and pernicious to the last degree
the evils of such association were aggravated by the unbroken idleness one evil inflamed the other reformation
or any kind of moral improvement was impossible the prisoner's career was inevitably downward till he struck the lowest depths
forced and constant intercourse with the most depraved individuals of his own class
the employment of those means and agents by which the lowest passions and the most vulgar propensities of man are perpetually kept in the highest state of excitement
drink gaming obscene and blasphemous language utter idleness the almost unrestricted admission of money and luxuries
uncontrolled conversation with visitors of the very worst description prostitutes thieves receivers of stolen goods
all the tumultuous and diversified passions and emotions which circumstances like these must necessarily generate
forbid the faintest shadow of a hope that in a soil so unfavorable for moral culture
any awakening truth salutary exhortation or imperfect resolutions of amendment can take root or grow
strong as were the foregoing remarks the inspectors wound up their report in still more trenchant language
framing a terrible indictment against those responsible for the condition of newgate their words deserve to be quoted in full
we cannot close these remarks say the inspectors without an expression of the painful feelings with which we submit to your lordship
this picture of the existing state of newgate
that in this vast metropolis the centre of wealth civilization and information
distinguished as the seat of religion worth and philanthropy
whereas to be found in operation every expedient by which ignorance may be superseded by knowledge idleness by industry and suffering by benevolence
that in the metropolis of this highly favored country to which the eyes of other lands turn for example a system of prison discipline such as that enforced in newgate
should be for a number of years in undisturbed operation not only in contempt of religion and humanity
but in opposition to the recorded denunciations of authority and in defiance of the express enactments of the law
is indeed a subject which cannot but impress every considerate mind with humiliation and sorrow
we trust however that the day is at hand when this stain will be removed from the character of the city of london
and when the first municipal authority of our land will be no longer subjected to the reproach of fostering an institution which outrages the rights and feelings of humanity
defeats the ends of justice and disgraces the profession of a christian country
the publication of this report raised a storm in the city and the corporation was roused to make an immediate protest
a committee of aldermen was forthwith appointed
to report upon the inspector's report
and the result was another lengthy blue book printed in the parliamentary papers eighteen thirty six
traversing where it was possible the statements of the inspectors and offering explanation and palliation of such evils as could not be denied
the inspectors retorted without loss of time reiterating their charges and pointing out that the committee of aldermen by its own admission
justified the original allegations it was impossible to deny the indiscriminate association the gambling drinking smoking quarrelling in the jail
the undue authority given to prisoners the levying of garnish under another name
the neglect of the condemned convicts the filthy condition of the wards the insufficiency of betting and clothing
the misemployment of officers and prisoners by the governor
the corporation evidently had the worst of it and began to feel the necessity for undertaking the great work of herform
next year we find the inspector's expressing their satisfaction that the full and faithful exposure which we felt it our duty to make of newgate
has been productive of at least some advantage
inasmuch as it has aroused the attention of those upon whom parliamentary reports and grand jury presentments had hitherto failed to make the slightest impression
the measures of improvement introduced were mainly as follows
the fixing of inspection holes in the doors and walls so as to ensure more supervision of windows opening into the well holes
to give better light and ventilation the construction of bed places three tears high alongside the walls for mails two tears for females
the provision of dining rooms and dining tables
the infirmary was enlarged the admission of visitors limited and the passing of articles prevented by a wire screem
the windows were to be glazced and painted to prevent prisoners from looking out
baths fumigating places for clothing wash house and the removal of dust bins completed the new arrangements in the main prison
in the press yard the press room and ward above it were parcelled out into nine separate sleeping cells
each was provided with an iron bedstead and a small desk at which the condemned man might read or write
but the one great and most crying evil remained unremedied
the mischief of jail associations say the inspectors
which has been demonstrably proved to be the fruitful source of all the abuses and irregularities which have so long disgraced newgate
is not only permitted still to exist in the prison but is rendered more powerful than before
in endeavoring to arrest contamination prisoners were more closely confined and associated in smaller numbers
but this had the effect of throwing them into closer contact and of making them more intimately acquainted with more directly influential upon one another
in the inspector's fourth report dated eighteen thirty nine
they returned to the charge and again call the corporation to task for their mismanagement of newgate
abuses and irregularities which had been partially remedied by the reform introduced in eighteen thirty seven were once more in the ascendant
in our late visits they say we have seen manifest indications of a retrograde movement in this respect
and a tendency to return to much of that laxity and remissness which formerly marked the management of this prison
again the following year the inspectors repeat their charge
the prominent evils of this prison newgate evils which the alterations made within the last four years have failed to remove
are the association of prisoners and the unusual contamination to which such association gives rise
for nearly twenty two hours out of the twenty four the prisoners are locked up during which time no officer is stationed in the ward with them
they go on to say
newgate is only less extensively injurious than formerly because it is less crowded
the effects of the imprisonment are to vitiate its inmates to extend their acquaintanceship with each other
to corrupt the prisoner charged with an offence of which he may be innocent and to confirm in guilt the young and inexperienced offender
the reports as the years flow on reiterate the same complaints
much bitterness of feeling is evidently engendered and the corporation grows more and more angry with the inspectors
the prison officials appear to be on the side of the inspectors to the great dissatisfaction of the corporation who claimed the full allegiance and support of its servants
in a resolution passed by the court of aldermen on eighteenth march eighteen forty two
i find it ordered that the ordinary of newgate be restricted from making any communications to the home office
or the inspectors of prisons and that he be required wholly to confine himself to the performance of his duty as prescribed by act of parliament
the inspectors were not to be deterred however by any opposition from the earnest discharge of their functions and continued to report against newgate
in their tenth report
they state that they are compelled by an imperative sense of duty to advert in terms of decided condemnation to the lamentable condition of the prisons of the city of london
newgate
gildsper cent compter and the city bridewell
in which the master evil of jail association and consequent contamination still continues to operate directly to the encouragement of crime
the plan adopted for ventilating the dining room on the master's side and that of the middle yard is very inefficient
it consists of several circular perforations about two inches in diameter
slanting downwards from the top of the walls to the outside adjoining the slaughter houses of newgate market and occasionally in hot weather
instead of ventilating the apartments they only serve to convey the offensive effluvia arising from the decaying animal matter into the dining rooms
sometimes the stench in hot weather is said to be very bad
many rats also come through these so called ventilators as they open close to the ground at the back of the prison
at the same time the inspectors animadvert strongly upon the misconduct of prisoners and the frequency of prison punishments
both offences and punishments affording a sufficient index to the practices going forward and they wind up by declaring
that a strict compliance with their duties gave them no choice but to report matters as we found them
and again and again to protest against newgate as it at present exists
no complete and permanent improvement was indeed possible while newgate remained unchanged
it was not till the erection of the new prison at holloway in eighteen fifty and the entire internal reconstruction of newgate according to new ideas
the chronicles of newgate volume two by arthur griffith's section eleven executions part one
i propose to return now to the subject of newgate executions
which we left at the time of the discontinuance of the long practised procession to tyburn
the reasons for this change were fully set forth in a previous chapter
the terrible spectacle was as demoralizing to the public for whose admonition it was intended
as the exposure was brutal and cruel towards the principal actors
the decision to remove the scene of action to the immediate front of the jail itself
was in the right direction as making the performance shorter and diminishing the area of display
but the old bailey was not exclusively used
at first and for some few years after seventeen eighty four executions took place occasionally at a distance from newgate
this was partly due to the survival of the old notion that the scene of the crime ought also to witness the retribution
partly perhaps because residence in and about the old bailey raised a loud protest against the constant erection of the scaffold in their neighborhood
as regards the first i find that in seventeen eighty six
john hogan the murderer of a mister odel an attorney who resided in charlotte street a rathbone place
was executed on a gibbet in front of his victim's house
lawrence jones a burglar was in seventeen ninety three ordered for execution in hatton garden near the house he had robbed
and when he evaded the sentence by suicide his body was exhibited in the same neighbourhood
extended upon a plank on the top of an open cart in his clothes and fettered
again as late as eighteen o nine and eighteen twelve execution dark on the banks of the thames was still retained
here john sutherland commander of the british armed transport the friends suffered on the twenty ninth june eighteen o nine
for the murder of his cabin boy whom he stabbed after much ill usage on board the ship as it lay in the tagus
on the eighteenth december eighteen twelve
two sailors charles palm and sam tilling were hanged at the same place for the murder of their captain james keith
of the trading vessel adventure upon the high seas
they were taken in a cart to the place of execution amidst a vast concourse of people
palm as soon as he was seated in the cart
put a quit of tobacco into his mouth and offered another to his companion who refused it with indignation
some indications of pity were offered for the fate of tilling palm execration alone
but the old bailey gradually and in spite of all objections urged monopolized the dread business of execution
the first affair of the kind on this spot was on the third december seventeen eighty three
when in pursuance of an order issued by the recorder to the sheriffs of middlesex and the keeper of his majesty's jail newgate
a scaffold was erected in front of that prison for the execution of several convicts named by the recorder
ten were executed
the scaffold hung with black and the inhabitants of the neighborhood having petitioned the sheriffs to remove the scene of execution to the old place
were told that the plan had been well considered and would be persevered in
the following twenty third april it is stated that the malefactors ordered for execution on the eighteenth instead
were brought out of newgate about eight in the morning and suspended on the gallows of a new construction
after hanging the usual time they were taken down and the machine cleared away in half an hour
by practice the art is much improved and there is no part of the world in which villains are hanged in so neat a manner and with so little ceremony
a full description of this new gallows which was erected in front of the debtor's door is to be found in contemporary records
the criminals are not exposed to view till they mount the fatal stage the last part of the stage or that next to the jail
is enclosed by a temporary roof under which are placed two seats for the reception of the sheriffs one on each side of the stairs leading to the scaffold
round the north west and south sides are erected galleries for the reception of officers attendants et cetera
and at the distance of five feet from the same is fixed a strong railing all round the scaffold to enclose a place for the constables
in the middle of this machinery is placed a movable platform in form of a trap door ten feet long by eight wide
on the middle of which is placed the gibbet extending from the jail across the old bailey
this movable platform is raised six inches higher than the rest of the scaffold and on it the convicts stand
it is supported by two beams which are held in their place by bolts the movement of the lever withdraws the bolts the platform falls in
and this being much more sudden and regular than that of a cart being drawn away has the effect of immediate death
a broadsheet dated april twenty fourth seventeen eighty seven describing an execution on the newly invented scaffold before the debtor's door
says the scaffold on which these miserable people suffered is a temporary machine which was drawn out of the yard of the sessions house by horses
it is supported by strong posts fixed into grooves made in the street
the whole is temporary being all calculated to take to pieces which are preserved within the prison
this contrivance appears to have been copied with improvements from that which had been used in dublin at a still earlier date
for that city claims the priority in establishing the custom of hanging criminals at the jail itself
the dublin engine of death as the gallows are styled in the account from which the following description is taken consisted of an iron bar
parallel to the prison wall and about four feet from it but strongly affixed there too with iron scroll claps
from this bar hang several iron loops in which the halters are tied
under this bar at a proper distance is a piece of flooring or platform
projecting somewhat beyond the range of the iron bar and swinging upon hinges affixed to the wall
the entrance upon this floor or leaf is from the middle window over the gate of the prison
and this floor is supported below
while the criminals stand upon it buy two pieces of timber which are made to slide in and out of the prison wall through apertures made for that purpose
when the criminals are tied up and prepared for their fate this floor suddenly falls down upon withdrawing the supporters inwards
they are both drawn at once by a windlass and the unhappy culprits remained suspended
this mode of execution it is alleged gave rise to the old vulgar chaff take care or you'll die at the fall of the leaf
the machinery in use in dublin is much the same as that employed at many jails nowadays
but the full apart and inwards of two leaves is considered superior
the latter is the method still followed at newgate
the sentence is inflicted in front of newgate were not limited to hang it
in the few years which elapsed between the establishment of the gallows at newgate
and the abolition of the practice of burning females for petty treason more than one woman suffered this penalty at the old bailey
one case is preserved by catnec
that of phoebe harris who in seventeen eighty eight was barbarously
executed and burnt before newgate for coining
she is described as a well made little woman something more than thirty years of age of a pale complexion and not disagreeable features
when she came out of prison she appeared languid and terrified and trembled greatly as she advanced to the stake
where the apparatus for the punishment she was about to experience
seemed to strike her mind with horror and consternation to the exclusion of all power of recollectedness in preparation for the approaching awful moment
she walked from the debtor's sdoor to a stake fixed in the ground about half way between the scaffold and newgate street
she was immediately tied by the neck to an iron bolt fixed near the top of the stick
and after praying fervently for a few minutes the steps on which she stood were drawn away and she was left suspended
a chain fastened by nails to the stake was then put round her body by the executioner with his assistants
two cart loads of fagots were piled about her and after she had hung for half an hour the fire was kindled
the flames presently burned the halter the body fell a few inches and hung then by the iron chain
the fire had not quite burnt out at twelve in nearly four hours that is to say
a great concourse of people attendit on this melancholy occasion
the change from tyburn to the old bailey had worked no improvement as regards the gathering together of the crowd or its demeanour
as many spectators as ever thronged to see the dreadful show
and they were packed into a more limited space disporting themselves as heretofore by brutal horse play coarse jests and frantic yells
it was still the custom to offer warm encouragement or bitter disapproval according to the character and antecedents of the sufferer
the highwayman whose exploits many in the crowd admired or emulated was cheered and bidden to die game
the man of better birth could hope for no sympathy whatever his crime
at the execution of governor wall in eighteen o two the furious hatred of the mob was plainly apparent in their appalling cries
his appearance on the scaffold was the signal for three prolonged shouts from an innumerable populace the brutal effusion of one common sentiment
it was said that so large a crowd had never collected since the execution of missus brownrigg nor had the public indignation risen so high
pyemen and ballad monger did their usual roaring trade amidst the dense throng
no sooner was the job finished then half a dozen competitors appeared each offering the identical rope for sale at a shilling an inch
one was the yeoman of the halter
a newgate official the executioner's assistant whom mister t j smith who was present at the execution
describes as a most diabolical looking little wretch jack ketch's head man
the yeoman was however undersold by his wife rosy emma
exuberant in talk and hissing hot from pie corner where she had taken her morning dose of gin and bitters
a little further off says mister smith was a laugh of a fellow past threescore years and ten
who had just arrived from the purlieus of black boy alley woebegone is romeo's apothecary exclaiming
here is the identical rope at sixpence an inch
mister smith's account of the condemned convict whose cell he was permitted to enter may be inserted here
he was introduced by the ordinary doctor ford a name familiar to the reader who met him at the felon's door
in his canonicals and with his head as stiffly erect as a sheriff's coachman
the ordinary gravely uttered come this way mister smith
as we crossed the press yard a cock crew and the solitary clanking of a restless chain was dreadfully horrible
the prisoners had not risen
they entered a stone cold room and were presently joined by the prisoner
he was death's counterfeit tall shrivelled and pale
and his soul shot out so piercingly through the port holes of his head that the first glance of him nearly petrified me
his hands were clasped and he was truly penitent
after the yeoman had requested him to stand up he pinioned him as the newgate phrases
and tied the cord with so little feeling that the governor wool who had not given the wretch his accustomed fee observed
you have tied me very tight upon which doctor ford ordered him to slacken the cord which he did but not without muttering
thank you sir said the governor to the doctor it is of little moment
he then made some observations to the attendant about the fire and turning to the doctor questioned him
do tell me sir i am informed i shall go down with great force is it so
after the construction an action of the machine had been explained the doctor asked the governor what kind of men he had commanded at goree
where the murder for which he was condemned had been committed
sir he answered they sent me the very rifraft
the poor soul then joined the doctor in prayer and never did i witness more contrition at any condemned sermon than he then evinced
the sheriff arrived attended by his officers to receive the prisoner from the keeper
a new hat was partly flattened on his head for owing to its being too small in the crown it stood many inches too high behind
as we were crossing the press yard
the dreadful execrations of some of the felons so shook his frame that he observed the clock had struck and quickening his pace
he soon arrived at the room where the sheriff was to give a receipt for his body according to the usual custom
before the colonel had been pinioned he had pulled out two white handkerchiefs one of which he bound over his temples so as nearly to conceal his eyes
the other he kept between his hands
over the handkerchief around his brows he placed a white cap
the new hat being on top of all
he was dressed in a mixed colored loose coat with a black collar swan down waistcoat blue pantaloons and white silk stockings
thus apparelled he ascended the stairs at the debtor's door
and stepped out onto the platform to be received as has been said by prolonged yells
these evidently deprived him of the small portion of fortitude he had summoned up
he bowed his head under extreme pressure of ignominy
and at his request the ordinary drew the cap further down over his face when in an instant
without waiting for any signal the platform dropped and he was launched into eternity
whenever the public attention had been specially called to a particular crime either on account of its atrocity
the doubtfulness of the issue or the superior position of the perpetrator
the attendance at the execution was certain to be tumultuous and the conduct of the mob disorderly
this was notably the case at the execution of holloway and haggarty
in eighteen o seven an event long remembered from the fatal and disastrous consequences which followed it
they were accused by a confederate who goaded by conscience had turned a prover of the murder of a mister steele
who kept a lavender warehouse in the city and who had gardens at feltam
whither he often went to distil the lavender returning to london the same evening
one night he was missing
and after a long interval his dead body was discovered shockingly disfigured in a ditch this was in eighteen o two
four years passed without the detection of the murderers
but in the beginning of eighteen o seven one of them at that time just sentenced to transportation
made a full confession and implicated holloway and hagarty
they were accordingly apprehended and brought to trial the informer handfield by name being accepted as king's evidence
conviction followed mainly on his testimony but the two men especially holloway stoutly maintained their innocence to the last
very great excitement prevailed in the town throughout the trial and this greatly increased when the verdict was known
an enormous crowd assembled to witness the execution amounting it was said to the hitherto unparalleled number of forty thousand
by eight o'clock not an inch of ground in front of the platform was unoccupied
the pressure soon became so frightful that many would have willingly escaped from the crowd but their attempts only increased the general confusion
very soon women began to scream with terror
some especially of low stature found it difficult to remain standing and several although held up for some time by the men nearest them
presently fell and were at once trampled to death
cries of murder murder were now raised and added greatly to the horrors of the scene
panic became general more women children and many men were borne down to perish beneath the feet of the rest
the most affecting and distressing scene was at green arbor lane just opposite the debtor store of the prison
here a couple of pie men had been selling their wares the basket of one of them which was raised upon a four legged stool was upset
the pieman stooped down to pick up his scattered stock and some of the mob not seeing what had happened stumbled over him
no one who fell ever rose again
among the rest was a woman with an infant at the breast
she was killed but in the act of falling she forced her child into the arms of a man near her and implored him in god's name to save it
the man needing all his care for his own life threw the child from him
and it passed along the heads of the crowd to be caught at last by a person who struggled with it to a cart and deposited it there in safety
in another part seven persons met their death by suffocation
in this convulsive struggle for bare existence people fought fiercely with one another and the weakest of course the women went under
one cart load of spectators having broken down some of its occupants fell off the vehicle and were instantly trampled to death
this went on for more than an hour and until the malefactors were cut down and the gallows removed
then the mob began to thin and the streets were cleared by the city marshals and a number of constables
the catastrophe exceeded the worst anticipations nearly one hundred dead and dying lay about and after all had been removed
the bodies for identification the wounded to hospitals a cart load of shoes hats petticoats and fragments of wearing apparel were picked up
among the dead was a sailor lad whom no one knew
he had his pockets filled with bread and cheese and it was generally supposed that he had come a long distance to see the fatal show
a tremendous crowd assembled when bellingham was executed in eighteen twelve for the murderer spencer percival at that time prime minister
but there were no serious accidents beyond those caused by the goring of a maddened over driven ox which forced its way through the crowd
precautions had been taken by the erection of barriers and the posting of placards at all the avenues to the old bailey on which was printed
beware of entering the crowd remember thirty poor persons were pressed to death by the crowd when haggarty and holloway were executed
the concourse was very great notwithstanding these warnings
it was still greater at fauntleroy's execution in eighteen twenty four when no less than one hundred thousand persons assembled it was said
every window and roof which could command a view of the horrible performance was occupied
all the avenues and approaches places even whence nothing whatever could be seen of the scaffold
were blocked by persons who had overflowed from the area in front of the jail
at crovassier's execution in eighteen forty it was the same or worse
as early as six a m the number assembled already exceeded that scene on ordinary occasions
by seven a m
the whole space was so thronged that it was impossible to move one way or the other
some persons were kept for more than five hours standing against the barriers and many nearly fainted from exhaustion
every window had its party of occupants the adjoining roofs were equally crowded
high prices were asked and paid for front seats or good standing room as much as five pounds was given for the attic story
of the lamb's coffee house
two pounds was a common price for a window
at the george public house to the south of the drop sir w watkin win
baronitt
hired a room for the night and morning which he and a large party of friends occupied before and during the execution
in an adjoining house that of an undertaker was lord alfred paget also with several friends
those who had hired apartments spent the night in them keeping up their courage with liquids and cigars
numbers of ladies were present although the public feeling was much against their attendants
one well dressed woman fell out of a first floor window on to the shoulders of the crowd below but neither she nor anyone else was greatly hurt
the city authorities had endeavoured to take all precautions against panic and excitement among the crowd
and caused a number of stout additional barriers to be erected in front of the scaffold
and although one of these gave way owing to the extraordinary pressure no serious accident occurred
some years later an eye witness published a graphic account of one of these scenes
soon after midnight on the sunday night for by this time the present practice of executing on monday morning had been pretty generally introduced
the crowd began to congregate in and about the old bailey
gin shops and coffee houses were the first to open doors and taps began to bid for tenants
for the various rooms upstairs
cries of comfortable room
excellent situation
beautiful prospect splendid view resounded on every side
by this time the workman might be heard busily erecting the gallows
the sounds of hammer and saw intermingled with the broad jeers and coarse jests of the rapidly increasing mob
one by one the huge uprights of black timber were fitted together
until presently the huge stage loomed dark above the crowd which was now ranged round the barriers
a throng of people whom neither rain snow storm nor darkness ever hindered from attending the show
they were mainly members of the criminal classes
their conversation was of companions and associates of former years long ago imprisoned transported hanged while they
hoary headed and hardened in gilt were still at large
they talked of the days when the convicts were hung up a dozen or more in a row
of those who had shown the white and those who had died game
the approaching ceremony had evidently no terrors for these idolaters of the gallows
with them were younger men and women
the former already vowed to the same criminal career and looking up to their elders with the respect due to successful practitioners
the latter unsexed and brutalized by dissipation
slipshod and slovenly in crushed bonnet and dirty shawl the gown fastened by a single hook
their harsh and half cracked voices full of maudlin besotted sympathy for those about to die
above the murmur and tumult of that noisy assembly the lowing and bleating of cattle as they were driven into the stalls and pens of smithfield
fell with a strange unnatural sound upon the ear
hush the unceasing murmur of the mob now breaks into a loud deep roar
a sound as if the ocean had suddenly broken through some ancient boundary against which its ever restless billows had for ages battered
the wide dark sea of heads is all at once in motion
each wave seems trying to overleap the other as they are drawn onwards towards this outlet
every link in that great human chain is shaken along the whole lengthened line has the motion jarred and each in turn cease
coiled up on the floor of the scaffold like a serpent the hangman's rope
the human hand that placed it there was only seen for a moment
as it lay white and ghastly upon the black boards and then again was a suddenly withdrawn as if ashamed of the deed it had done
the loud shout of the multitude once more subsided or only fell upon the abstracted ear like the dreamy murmur of an ocean shell
then followed sounds more distinct and audible in which ginger beer pies fried fish sandwiches and fruit
were vended under the names of notorious murders highwaymen and criminals
famous in the annals of newgate for the hardihood they had displayed in the hour of execution when they terminated their career of crime at the gallows
threading his way among these itinerant vendors was seen the meek faced deliverer of tracts the man of good intentions now bonneted
now laughed at the skirt of his seedy black coat torn across yet
though pulled right and left or sent headlong into the crowd by the swing of some brutal and muscular arm
never once from that pale face passed away its benign and patient expression
but ever the same form moved along in the fulfilment of his mission in spite of all persecution
another fight followed the score which had already taken place this time two women were the combatants
blinded with their long hair they tore at each other like two furies their bonnets and caps were trodden underfoot in the kennel
and lay disregarded beside the body of the poor dog which while searching for its master in the crowd
was an hour before kicked to death by the savage and brutal mob
another deep roar louder than any which had preceded it broke from the multitude
then came the cry of hats off and
down in front as at a theatr
it was followed by the deep and solemn booming of the death bell from the church of saint sepulchre
the iron knill which rang upon the beating heart of the living man who was about to die
and with blanched cheek and sinking we turned away from the scene
in thus describing the saturnalia before the gallows i have been drawn on somewhat beyond the period with which i am at present dealing
let me retrace my steps and speak more in detail of the treatment of the condemned in those blood thirsty and brutally in different days
and of their demeanour after sentence until the last penalty was paid
one of the worst evils was the terrible and long protracted uncertainty as to the result
in the case of convicted murderers only was prompt punishment inflicted
and with them indeed this dispatch amounted to undue precipitancy
forty eight hours was the limit of time allowed to the unhappy man to make his peace and during that time he was still kept on a bare allowance of bread and water
but the murderers formed only a small proportion of the total number sentenced to death and for the rest there was a long period of anxious suspense
although in the long run mercy generally prevailed and very few capitally convicted for crimes less than murder actually suffered
thus in the years between may first eighteen twenty seven and thirtieth april eighteen thirty one
no less than four hundred and fifty one sentences of death for capital crimes were passed at the old bailey
but of these three hundred and ninety six were reversed by the king in council and only fifty two were really executed
already the severity of our criminal code and the number of capital felonies upon the statute book had brought a reaction
and while the courts adhered to the letter of the law appeals were constantly made to the royal prerogative of mercy
this was more particularly the practice in london
judges on a size were satisfied with simply recording a sentence of death against offenders whom they did not think deserved the extreme penalty
at the old bailey almost everyone capitally convicted by a jury was sentenced to be hanged
the result in the latter case was left in the first place to the king in council
but there was a further appeal then as now to the king himself or practically to the home secretary
neither in town or country were cases entirely taken on their own merits
convicted offenders might have good or bad luck
they might be arraigned when their particular crime was uncommon and were then nearly certain to escape
or theirs might be one of many and it might be considered necessary to make an example
in this latter it might fairly be said that a man was put to death less for his own sins than for the crimes of others
the absurdity of the system its irregularity and cruelty were fully touched upon by the inspectors of prisons in their first report
they found at newgate under disgraceful conditions as already described
seventeen capital convicts upon all of whom the sentence of death had been passed
eventually too only of the whole number suffered
two others were sentenced to three months imprisonment and the balance to varying terms
nothing could be more strongly marked than the contrast between the ultimate destiny of different individuals all abiding the same awful doom
on the one hand the gallows on the other a short imprisonment
the inspectors very properly desire to call attention to the inevitable tendency in this mode of dealing with the most awful sanctions of the law
to make those sanctions an object of contemptuous mockery
the consequences were plainly proved to the inspectors
capitally convicted prisoners did as a matter of fact treat with habitual and inexpressible levity the sentence of death
of this i have treated at length in the last chapter
the time thus spent varied considerably
but it was seldom less than six weeks
it all depended upon the sovereign's disposition to do business
sometimes the privy council did not meet for months and during all that time the convicts languished with hope
nearly indefinitely deferred
when the council had decided the news was conveyed to newgate by the recorder who made his report as it was called
the time of the arrival of this report was generally known at newgate
and its contents were anxiously awaited by both convicts in the press yard and their friends collected in a crowd outside the gates
sometimes the report was delayed
on one occasion mister wackfield tells us the recorter who had attended the council at windsor did not deliver the report till the following day
the prisoners and their friends therefore were kept in a state of the most violent suspense for many hours
during which they counted the moments the prisoners in their cells as usual and their friends in the street in front of newgate where they passed the night
i have heard the protracted agony of both classes described by those who witnessed it in terms so strong that i am unwilling to repeat them
a crowd of men and women who passed the night in front of newgate began as soon as the hour was passed when they had expected the report
to utter imprecations against the recorder the secretary of state the council and the king
they never ceased cursing until the passion of anger so excited was exchanged for joy in some and grief in others
i myself heard more than one of those whose lives were spared by that decision of the council
afterwards express a wish to murder the recorder for having kept them so long in suspense
the recorder's report generally reached newgate late at night
its receipt was immediately followed by the promulgation of its contents to the persons most closely concerned
which was done with a sort of ceremony intended to be impressive
the whole of the convicts were assembled together in one ward and made to kneel down
to them entered the chaplain or ordinary of newgate in full canonicals
who in solemn tones communicated to each in turn the fate in store for him
the form of imparting the intelligence was generally the same
so and so i am sorry to tell you that it is all against you or
a b your case has been taken into consideration by the king in council and his majesty has been mercifully pleased to spare your life
the fatal news was not always received in the same way
the men who were doomed often fell down in convulsions upon the floor
sometimes any who had had a narrow escape fainted but the bulk of those respited looked on with unfeeling indifference
the chronicles of newgate volume two by arthur griffith's section twelve
executions part two
it is satisfactory to be able to record
that some consideration was shown the capital convict actually awaiting execution
even so severe a critic as mister wickfield states that a stranger to the scene
would be astonished
to observe the peculiar tenderness i was going to add respect
which persons under sentence of death obtaine from all the officers of the prison
before sentence a prisoner has only to observe the regulations of the jail in order to remain neglected and unnoticed
once ordered to the cells
friends of all classes suddenly rise up
his fellow prisoners the turnkeys the chaplain
the keepers
and the sheriffs all seem interested in his fate and he can make no reasonable request
that is not at once granted by whomsoever he may address
this rule has some
but very few exceptions
such as were a hardened offender behaves with great levity and brutality as if he cared not for his life
and thought every one anxious to promote his death
mister wickfield goes on to remark that persons convicted of forgery
excited an extraordinary degree of interest in all who approached them

this was noticeable with faunt le roy
who on account of his birth and antecedents
was allowed to occupy a turnkey's room
and kept altogether separate from the other prisoners until the day of his death
it cannot be denied however that the ordinary's treatment was somewhat unfeeling
and in proof thereof
i will quote an extract from the reverend gentleman's own journal
he seems to have improved the occasion when preaching the condemned sermon before fantleroy by pointing a moral from that unhappy man's own case
for this
the chaplain was a few days later summoned before the jail committee of aldermen
and informed that the public would not in future be admitted
to hear the condemned sermon
i was also informed writes mister cotton
that this resolution was in consequence of there the alderman's disapproving of the last discourse delivered by me
previous to the execution of henry fauntleroy for uttering a forged security
in which it was said i had enlarged upon the heinous nature of his crime
and warned the public to avoid such conduct
i was informed that this unnecessarily harassed his feelings and that the object of such sermons was solely to console the prisoner
and that from the time of his conviction nothing but what is consolatory should be addressed to a criminal
one of the alder men moreover informed me that the whole court of aldermen were unanimous in their opinion on this subject
as to the exclusion of strangers on these occasions
the experience i have had convinces me that one and perhaps the only good of an execution
i ete a solemn admonition to the public
will thereby be lost
probably the reader will side with the aldermen against the ordinary
this episode throws some doubt upon the tenderness and proper feeling exhibited by the chaplain towards the most deserving members of his criminal flock
and the idea will be strengthened
by the following account of the sunday service in the prison chapel
on the occasion when the condemned sermon was preached
the extract
is from mister e gibbon wakefields brow shure
the date eighteen twenty eight just three years after faunt le roy's death
strangers were now excluded but the sheriffs attended in state wearing their gold chains
while behind their pew stood a couple of tall footmen in state liveries
the sheriffs were in one gallery
in the other opposite were the convicts capitally convicted who had been respited
down below
between the galleries was the mass of the prison population

the schoolmaster and the juvenile prisoners being seated round the communion table
opposite the pulpit
in the centre of the chapel was the condemned pew
m
a large dock like erection painted black
those who sat in it
were visible to the whole congregation
and still more to the ordinary
whose desk and pulpit were just in front of the condemned pew and within a couple of yards of it
the occupants of this terrible black pew
were the last always to enter the chapel
upon the occasion which i am describing they were four in number
and here i will continue the narrative in mister wickfield's own words
first is a youth of eighteen condemned for stealing in a dwelling house goods valued above five pounds
his features have no felonious cast
he steps boldly with head upright
looks to the women's gallery and smiles
his intention is to pass for a brave fellow
but the attempt fails he trembles his knees knocked together
and his head droops as he enters the condemned pew
the next convict is clearly and unmistakably a villain
he is a hardened offender
previously cast for life
reprieved
transported to australia
and since returned without pardon
for this offence the punishment is death
he has however doubly earned his sentence and is actually condemned for burglary committed since his arrival in england
his look at the sheriff said the ordinary is full of scorn and defiance
the third convict is a sheep stealer
a poor ignorant fellow in whose crime are mitigating circumstances
but who is left to die on the supposition that this is not his first conviction
and still more because a good many sheep have of late been stolen by other people
he is quite content to die
indeed the chaplain and others have brought him firmly to believe that his situation is enviable and that the gates of heaven are open to receive him
the last of the four is said to have been a clergyman of the church of england
condemned for forgery
a miserable old man in a tattered suit of black
already he is half dead
great efforts have been made to save his life
friends even utter strangers have interceded for him and to the last he has boiyed himself up by hope of reprief
now his doom is sealed irrevocably
i
and he has given himself up to despair
he staggers towards the pew
reels into it
stumbles forward
flings himself on the ground
and by a curious twist of the spine
buries his head under his body
the sheriff's shudder
their inquisitive friends craned forward
the keeper frowns on the excited congregation
the lately smirking footmen close their eyes and forget their liveries
the ordinary clasps his hands
the turnkeys cry hush
and the old clerk
lifts up his cracked voice saying
let us sing to the praise and glory of god
the morning hymn is sung first as if to remind the condemned that next morning at eight a m they are to die
the service proceeds
at last the burial service is reached
the youth alone is able to read but from long want of practice he is at a loss to find the place in his prayer book
the ordinary observes him
looks to the sheriffs and says aloud
the service for the dead
the youth's hands tremble as they hold the book upside down
the burglar is heard to mutter an angry oath
the sheep stealer smiles and extending his arms upwards looks with a glad expression to the roof of the chapel
the forger has never moved
let us pass on
all have sung the lamentation of a sinner
and have seemed to pray especially for those now awaiting the awful execution of the law
we come to the sermon
the ordinary of newgate is an orthodox unaffected church of england divine
who preaches plain homely discourses as fit as any religious discourse can be fit for the irritated audience
the sermon of this day whether eloquent or plain useful or useless must produce a striking effect at the moment of its delivery
the text without another word is enough to raise the wildest passions of the audience
for a while the preacher addresses himself to the congregation at large who listen attentively
except the clergyman and the burglar the former of whom is still rolled up at the bottom of the condemned pew
while the eyes of the latter are wandering round the chapel and one of them is occasionally winked impudently at some acquaintance amongst the prisoners for trial
at length the ordinary pauses and then in a deep tone which though hardly above a whisper is audible to all says
now for you my poor fellow mortals
who are about to suffer the last penalty of the law
but why should i repeat the whole
it is enough to say that in the same solemn tone he talks about the minutest of crimes punishments bonds shame
ignominy sorrow sufferings wretchedness pangs
childless parents widows and helpless orphans broken and contrite hearts and death to morrow morning for the benefit of society
the dying men are dreadfully agitated
the young stealer in a dwelling house no longer has the least pretence to bravery
he grasps the back of the pew
his legs give way he utters a faint groan and sinks on the floor
why does no one stir to help him
where would be the use
the hardened burglar moves not nor does he speak
but his face is of an ashy paleness and if you look carefully you may see the blood trickling from his lip
which he has bitten unconsciously or from rage or to rouse his fainting courage
the poor sheep stealer is in a frenzy
he throws his hands far from him and shouts aloud
mercy good lord mercy is all i ask
the lord in his mercy come
there
there i see the lamb of god
oh how happy
oh this is happy
meanwhile the clergyman still bent into the form of a sleeping dog
struggles violently
his feet legs hands and arms even the muscles of his back
move with a quick jerking motion not naturally but as it were like the affected parts of a galvanised corpse
suddenly he utters a short sharp scream and all is still
a silence is short
as the ordinary proceeds to conclude
the women set up a yell which is mixed with a rustling noise occasioned by the removal of those whose hysterics have ended in fainting
the sheriffs cover their faces and one of their inquisitive friends blows his nose with his glove
the keeper tries to appear unmoved but his eye wanders anxiously over the combustible assembly
the children round the communion table stare and gape with childish wonder
the two masses of prisoners for trial undulate and slightly murmur
while the capital convicts who were lately in that black pew appear faint with emotion
this exhibition lasts for some minutes and then the congregation disperses
the condemned returning to the cells the forger carried by the turnkeys the youth sobbing aloud convulsively as a passionate child
the burglar muttering curses and savage expressions of defiance whilst the poor sheep stealer shakes hands with the turnkeys
whistles merrily and points upwards with madness in his look
mister wickfield winds up his graphic but somewhat sensational account by describing another religious service which may appropriately be inserted here
he says on the day of execution there is no service in the chapel of newgate
on the following day the capital convicts whose companions have been hanged are required to return thanks for their narrow escape
the firmest disbeliever in religion if he had not lately been irritated by taking part in such a scene as the condemned service in newgate
could hardly witness this ceremony without being affected the men who were so lately snatched from the jaws of death
neil whilst the rest of the congregation sit and the ordinary in a tone of peculiar solemnity says
almighty god father of all mercies we thine unworthy servants do give thee most humble and hearty thanks
for all thy goodness and loving kindness to us and to all men
particularly to those who desire now to offer up their praises and thanksgivings for thy late mercies vouchsafed unto them
could any one knowing the late situation of the kneeling men looking as they do at the empty pew
occupied when they saw it last but a few hours ago by their comrades who are now dead
could any one not disgusted with the religious ceremonials of newgate witnessed this scene without emotion
hardly any one
but what are the feelings of those who take part in it
i have been present at the scene not less than twenty times and have invariably observed
that many of the kneeling men or boys laughed while they knelt pinched each other and when they could do so without fear of being seen by any officer of the prison
winked at other prisoners in derision of what was taking place and i have frequently heard men and lads who had been of the kneeling party
boast to their companions after the service that they had wiped their eyes during the thanksgiving to make the ordinary believ they had been crying
although this misapplication of religious services still went on
the outside public continued to be excluded from the newgate chapel on the day the condemned sermon was preached
this very proper rule was however set aside on the sunday preceding couvoissier's execution
so many applications for admission were made to the sheriffs
that they reluctantly agreed to open the gallery which had formerly been occupied by strangers on these occasions
cards were issued and to such an extent that although the service was not to commence till half past ten by nine a m
all the avenues to the prison gates were blocked by ticket holders
in spite of the throng owing to the excellent arrangements made by the sheriffs
no inconvenience was suffered by the congregation among whom were lord adolphus fitz clarence lord coventry
lord paget lord bruce several members of the house of commons and a few ladies
contemporary accounts give a minute description of the demeanor of the convict upon this solemn occasion
he sat on a bench before the pulpit
the hideous condemned pew had been swept away
and never once raised his eyes during the service
in fact his looks denoted extreme sorrow and contrition
and he seemed to suffer great inward agitation when the ordinary particularly alluded to the crime for the perpetration of which he stood condemned
mister carver the ordinary appears to have addressed himself directly to crovassier
and to have dwelt with more emphasis than good taste upon the nature of the crime and the necessity for repentance
but the chaplain admitted that the solitude of the convict cell
was more appropriate for serious reflection and profitable ministration than this exciting occasion before a large and public assembly
so far as i can find quivassier was the last condemned criminal who was thus exhibited to a crowd of morbidly curious spectators
the atrocity of the murder no doubt attracted extraordinary attention to it
the crowd outside newgate on the day of execution has already been described but there was also a select gathering of distinguished visitors within the jail
first came the sheriffs the under sheriff and several aldermen and city officials then lord power's court and several other peers of the realm
mister charles kine the tragedian was also present
drawn to this terrible exhibition by the example of his father the more celebrated edmund king who had witnessed the execution of thistlewood
with a view as he himself said to his professional studies
but there is little doubt that his executions became more rare they made more impression on the public mind
already a strong dislike to the reckless and almost indiscriminate application of the extreme penalty was apparent in all classes
and the mitigation of the criminal code for which romilly had so strenuously labored
was daily more and more of an accomplished fact
in eighteen thirty two
capital punishment was abolished for forgery except in cases of forging or altering wills or powers of attorney to transfers stock
nevertheless after that date no person whatever was executed for this offence
in the same year capital punishment was further restricted and ceased to be the legal sentence for coining
sheep or horse stealing and stealing in a dwelling house
housebreaking as distinguished from burglary was similarly exempted in the following year
next the offences of returning from transportation
stealing post office letters and sacrilege were no longer punishable with death
in eighteen thirty seven lord john russell's act swept away a number of capital offences including cutting and maiming rick burning
robbery burglary and arson
within a couple of years the number of persons sentenced to death in england had fallen from four hundred and thirty eight in eighteen thirty seven
to fifty six in eighteen thirty nine
gradually the application of capital punishment became more and more restricted and was soon the penalty for murder alone
while in london for instance in eighteen twenty nine twenty four persons had been executed for crimes other than murder
from eighteen thirty two eighteen forty four not a single person had been executed in the metropolis except for this the gravest crime
in eighteen thirty seven the death penalty was practically limited to murder or attempts to murder
and in eighteen forty one this was accepted as the almost universally established rule
seven other crimes however were still capital by law and so continued till the passing of the criminal consolidation acts of eighteen sixty one
with the amelioration of the criminal code other cruel concomitants of execution also disappeared
in eighteen thirty two the dissection of bodies cut down from the gallows which had been decreed centuries previously was abolished
the most recent enactment and force was the ninth george the fourth calp thirty one which directed the dissection of all bodies of executed murderers
the idea being to intensify the dread of capital punishment that such dread was not universal or deep seated may be gathered from the fact
that authentic cases were known previous to the first sighted act of criminals selling their own bodies to surgeons for dissection
this dissection was carried out for newgate prisoners in surgeon's hall adjoining newgate
the sight of the present sessions house of the old bailey and the operation was witnessed by students and a number of curious spectators
lord ferriera's body was brought to surgeon's hall after execution in his own carriage in six
after the post mortem had been carried out the corpse was exposed to view in a first floor room
pennant speaks of surgeon's hall as a handsome building ornamented with ionic pilasters and with a double flight of steps to the first floor
beneath is a door for the admission of the bodies of murderers and other felons there were other public dissecting rooms for criminals
one was attached to hicks hall the clerkenwell sessions house built out of moneys provided by sir baptist hicks a wealthy alderman of the reign of james the first
persons were still living in eighteen fifty five who had witnessed dissections at hickshall and
whom the horrid scene with the additional effect of some noted criminals hanging on the walls
drove out again sick and faint
as we have heard summ relate and with pale and terrified features to get a breath of air
the dissection of executed criminals was abolished soon after the discovery of the crime of burking
with the idea that ignominy would no longer attach to an operation which ceased to be compulsory for the most degraded beings
and that executors or persons having lawful possession of the bodies
of people who had died friendless would voluntarily surrender them for the advancement of medical science
another brutal practice had nearly disappeared about the time of the abolition of dissection this was the public exhibition of the body
as was done in the case of missus fippo the murderess who was executed in front of newgate in seventeen ninety eight
and her body publicly exhibited in a place built for the purpose in the old bailey
about this time i find that the bodies of two murderers clench and mackay
were publicly exposed in a stable in little bridge street near apothecary's hall
surgeons whole being let to the lieutenancy of the county for the accommodation of the militia
in eighteen eleven williams who murdered the mars in ratcliffe highway having committed suicide in jail to escape hanging
it was determined that a public exhibition should be made of the body through the neighborhood which had been the scene of the monster's crimes
a long procession was formed headed by constables who cleared the way with their staves
then came the newly formed horse patrol with drawn cutlasses
parish officers peace officers the high constable of the county of middlesex on horseback and then the body of williams
extended at full length on an inclined platform
erected on the cart about four feet high at the head and gradually sloping towards the horse giving a full view of the body
which was dressed in blue trousers and a blue and white striped waistcoat but without a coach as when found in the cell
on the left side of the head the fatal more
and on the right the ripping chisel with which the murderers had been committed were exposed to view
the countenance of williams was ghastly in the extreme
and the whole had an appearance too horrible for description
the procession traversed ratcliff twice halting for a quarter of an hour in front of the victim's dwelling
and was accompanied throughout by an immense concourse of persons eager to get a sight of the murderer's remains
all the shops in the neighborhood were shut and the windows and tops of the houses were crowded with spectators
hanging in chains upon the gibbet which had served for the execution
or on another specially erected on some commanding spot had fallen into disuse by eighteen thirty two
but there was an attempt to revive it at that date when the act for dispensing with the dissection of criminals was past
a clause was inserted to the effect that
the bodies of all prisoners convicted of murder should either be hung in chains or buried under the gallows on which they had been executed
according to the discretion of the court before whom the prisoners might be tried
the revival of this barbarous practice caused much indignation in certain quarters
but it was actually tried in two provincial towns leicester and durham
at the first named the exhibition nearly created a tumult and the body was taken down and buried
but not before the greatest scandal had been caused by the unseemly proceedings of the crowd that flocked to see the sight a sort of fair was held
gaming tables were set up cards were played under the gibbet to the disturbance of the public peace and the annoyance of all decent people
at jaro stake where the dura murderer's body was exposed they were similar scenes mingled with compassion for the culprit's family
and a subscription was set on foot for them then and there at the foot of the gibbet
later on after dark some friends of the deceased stole the body and buried it in the sand and this was the end of hanging in chains
after this a law was passed which prescribed that the bodies of all executed murderers should be buried within the walls of the jail
although these objectionable practices had disappeared
there were still many shocking incidents and executions owing to the bungling and unskilful way in which the operation was performed
the rope still broke sometimes although it was not often that the horrid scene seen at jersey at the beginning of the century was repeated
there the hangman added his weight to that of the suspended culprit
and having first pulled him sideways then got upon his shoulders so that the rope broke
to the great surprise of all who witnessed this dreadful scene
the poor criminal rose straight upon his feet with a hangman on his shoulders and immediately loosened the rope with his fingers
after this the sheriffs sent for another rope but the spectators interfered and the man was carried back to jail
the whole case was referred to the king and the poor wretch whose crime had been a military one
was eventually pardoned
a somewhat similar event happened at chester not long afterwards the ropes by which two offenders were turned off
broke a few inches from their necks
they were taken back to jail and were again brought out in the afternoon by which time fresh and stronger ropes have been procured
and the sentence was properly and completely carried out
other cases might be quoted
especially that of william snow
alia's sketch who slipped from the gallows at exeter and fell to the ground
he soon rose to his feet and hearing the sorrowful exclamations of the populace coolly said
good people do not be hurried i am not i can wait
similar cases were not wanting as regards the executions before newgate others were not less horrible although there was no failure of apparatus
sometimes the condemned man made a hard fight for life
when charles white was executed in eighteen twenty three for arson he arranged a handkerchief
in such a way that the executioner found a difficulty in pinioning his hands
white managed to keep his wrists asunder and continued to struggle with the officials for some time
eventually he was pinioned with a cord in the usual manner
on the scaffold he made a violent attempt to loosen his bonds and succeeded in getting his hands free
then with a strong effort he pushed off the white cap and tried to liberate his neck from the halter which by this time had been adjusted
the hangman summoned assistance and with help tied the cap over white space with a handkerchief
the miserable wretch during the whole of this time was struggling with the most determined violence to the great horror of the spectators
still he resisted
and having got from the falling drop to the firm part of the platform he nearly succeeded in tearing the handkerchief from his eyes
however the ceremony went forward and when the signal was given the drops sank
a wretched man did not fall with it but jumped on to the platform and seizing the rope with his hands tried to avoid strangulation
the spectacle was horrible
the convict was half on the platform half hanging and the convulsions of his body were appalling
the crowd vociferously yelled their disapproval and at length
the executioner forced the struggling criminal from the platform so that the rope sustained his whole weight
his face was visible to the whole crowd and was fearful to behold
even now his sufferings were not at an end
and his death was not compassed until the executioner terminated his sufferings by hanging on to his legs
when luigi baronelli was executed in eighteen fifty five
through the improper adjustment of the rope his sufferings were prolonged for five minutes
his chest heaved and it was evident that his struggle was a fearful one
a worse case still was that of william bowsfield
who when awaiting execution for murder about the same date
had attempted to throw himself upon the fire in his condemned cell
he was in consequence so weak when brought out for execution that he had to be carried by four men
to supporting his body and to his legs
his wretched abject condition seated in a chair under the drop was such as almost to unnerve the executioner cowcraft
who had been further upset by a letter threatening to shoot him when he appeared to perform his task
cowcraft the moment he had adjusted the cap and rope ran down the steps drew the bolt and disappeared
for a second or two the body hung motionless then with a strength that astonished the attendant officials
balsfield slowly drew himself up
and rested with his feet on the right side of the drop
one of the turnkeys rushed forward and pushed him off
again
a wretched creature succeeded in obtaining foothold
but this time on the left side of the drop
calcraft was forced to return and he once more pushed bowsfield off
who for the fourth time regained his foothold again he was repelled
this time colcraft adding his wayht to the body and the strangulation was completed
it was stated in evidence before the commission on capital punishment in eighteen sixty four
the cowcraft's method of hanging was very rough much the same as if he had been hanging a dog
there has never been much science in the system of carrying out the extreme penalty in this country the finisher of the law
has come more by chance than fitness or special education to exercise his loathsome office
cowcraft of whom mention has just been made was by trade a lady's shoemaker
and before he took to hanging he was employed as a watchman at reed's brewery in licrorpod street
he was at first engaged as assistant to the executioner tom chesher but in due course arose to be chief
he was always known as a mild mannered man of simple tastes much given to angling in the new river and a devoted rabbit fancier
he was well known in the neighbourhood where he resided and the street gamins cried jack catch as he went along the street
while celcraft was in office other aspirents to fame appeared in the field
one was a skern
who had been a convicted prisoner at york but who consented to act as hangmen when calcraft was engaged and no other functionary could be obtained
it was not always easy to hire a hangman
there is still extant a curious petition presented to the treasury by ralph griffith esquire high sheriff of flitcher
which sets forth that the petitioner had been at great expense by sending clerks and agents to liverpool and shrewsbury to hire an executioner
the man to be hanged belonged to wales and no welshman would do the job
travelling expenses of these agents cost fifteen pounds and another ten pounds were spent in the hire of a shropshire man
who deserted and was pursued but without success
another man was hired himself a convict whose fees for self and wife were twelve guineas
then came the cost of the gallows
four pounds twelve shillings and finally the funeral cart coffin and other petty expenses amounting to seven pounds ten
the chronicles of newgate volume two by arthur griffith's section thirteen newgate notorieties part one
in chapter two of the present volume i brought down the record of crime to the second decade of the present century
i propose now to continue the subject and to devote a couple of chapters to criminal occurrences of a more recent date
only premising that as accounts become more voluminous i shall be compelled to deal with fewer cases
taking in preference those which are typical and invested with peculiar interest it is somewhat remarkable that a market change soon comes over the calendar
certain crimes those against the person especially diminished gradually they became less easy or remunerative
police protection was better and more effective
the streets of london were well lighted the suburbs were more populous and regularly patrolled
people too were getting into the habit of carrying but little cash about them and no valuables but their watches or personal jewellery
street robberies offered fewer inducements to depreditors and evildoers were compelled to adopt other methods of preying upon their fellows
this led to a rapid and market increase in all kinds of fraud
and prominent in the criminal annals of newgate in these later years will be found numerous remarkable instances of this class of offence
forgeries committed systematically and for long periods as in the case of faunt le roy
to cover enormous defalcations the fabrication of deeds wills and false securities
for the purpose of misappropriating funds or feloniously obtaining cash
thefts of bullion bank notes specie and gold dust planned with consummate ingenuity
eluding the keenest vigilance and carried out with reckless daring
jewel boxes cleverly stolen under the very noses of owners or caretakers
as time passed
the extraordinary extension of all commercial operations led to many entirely novel and often gigantic financial frauds
the credulity of investors the unscrupulous dishonesty of bankers
a slackness of supervision over wholly irresponsible agents produced many terrible monetary catastrophes
and lodged men like coal robson and redpath in newgate
while the varying conditions of social life thus brought about many changes in the character of ffences against property
those against the person became more and more limited to the most heinous or those which menaced or destroyed life
there was no increase in murder or manslaughter the number of such crimes remained pretty constant proportionately to population
nor did the methods by which they were perpetrated greatly vary from those in times past
the causes also continued much the same
passion revenge cupidity sudden ebullitions of homicidal rage
the cold blooded calculating atrocity born of self interest were still the irresistible incentives to kill
the brutal ferocity of the wild beast once arousedthe same means the same weapons were employed to do the dreadful deed
the same and happily often futile precautions taken to conceal a crime
pegsworth and green acre and daniel good merely reproduce types that had gone before and that have since reappeared
ester hibner was as inhuman in her ill usage of the parish apprentice she killed as martha brownrigg had been
thertel and hunt followed in the footsteps of buillings wood and katharine hays
curevassier might have lived a century earlier
hawker was found upon the scene of his crime irresistibly attracted thither as was theodore garddell
now and again there seemed to be a recurrence of a murder epidemic
as there had been before as in the year eighteen forty nine a year memorable for the rush murders at norwich
the glease and wilson murder at liverpool
that of the mannings in london and of many more
men like mobs the miscreant known as general hay now on account of his bloodthirstiness still murdered their wives
or like cannon the chimney sweeper who savagely killed the policeman
a not altogether new crime however akin to murder
although happily never passing beyond dastardly attempts crept up in these times and was often frequently repeated within a short interval
the present queen very soon after her accession
became the victim of the most cowardly and unmanly outrages and the attempted murder of the sovereign by oxford in eighteen forty
was followed in the very next year by those of francis and of being in too consecutive months
while in eighteen fifty her majesty was the victim of another outrage at the hands of one pate
these crimes had their origin too often in the disordered brains of lunatics at large like captain good
their perpetrators were charged with high treason but met with merciful clemency as irresponsible beings
but at various sdates treason more distinct and tangible came to the front attempts to levy war against the state
the well known cato street conspiracy
which grew out of disturbed social conditions after the last french war amidst general distress
and when the people were beginning to agitate for a larger share of political power was among the earliest and to some extent the most desperate of these
its ringleaders thistlewood and the rest were after capture honored by committal as state prisoners to the tower
but they came one and all to newgate for trial at the old bailey and remained thereafter conviction till they were hanged
later on the chartists agitated persistently for the concession embraced in the so called people's charter many of which
are by this time actually and by more legitimate efforts engrafted upon our constitution
but the chartists sought their ends by riot and rebellion and gained only imprisonment for their pains
some five hundred in all were arrested but as only three of these were lodged in newgate i shall not recur to them in my narrative
the cato street conspiracy would have been simply ridiculous but for the recklessness of the desperadoes who planned it
that some thirty or more needy men should hope to revolutionize england is a sufficient proof of the absurdity of their attempt
but they proceeded in all seriousness and would have shrunk from no outrage or atrocity in furtherance of their foolhardy enterprise
the massacre of the whole of the cabinet ministers at one stroke was to be followed by an attack
upon the old man and the old woman as they styled the mansion house and the bank of england
at the former the provisional government was to be established
which under thistlewood as dictator was to rule the nation by first handing over its capital to fire and pillage
this thistlewood had seen many vicissitudes throughout his strange adventurous career the son of a respectable lincolnshire farmer
he became a militia officer and married a woman with ten thousand pounds in which however she had only a life interest
she died early and thistlewood left to his own resources
followed the profession of arms first in the british service and then in that of the french revolutionary government
it was during this period that he was said to have imbibed his revolutionary ideas
returning to england
he found himself rich in a small landed property which he presently sold to a man who became bankrupt before he had paid over the purchase money
after this he tried farming but failed
he married again and came to london where he soon became notorious as a reckless gambler and a politician holding the most extreme views
in this way he formed the acquaintance of watson and others with whom he was arraigned for treasonable practices and imprisoned
on his release he sent a challenge to lord sidma the home secretary and was again arrested and imprisoned
on his second release goaded by his fancied wrongs he began to plot a dark and dreadful revenge
and thus the conspiracy in which he was the prime mover took shape and came to a head
the government obtained early and full information of the nefarious scheme
one of the conspirators by name edwards
made a voluntary confession to sir herbert taylor one morning at windsor after which thistlewood and his accomplices were closely watched
and measures taken to arrest them when their plans were so far developed that no doubt could remain as to their guilt
the day appointed for the murder and rising actually arrived before the authorities interfered
it was the day on which lord harrowby was to entertain his colleagues at dinner in grovenor square
the occasion was considered excellent by the conspirators for disposal of the whole cabinet at one blow
and it was arranged that one of their numbers should noctk at lord harrowby's door on the pretence of leaving a parcel
and that when it was opened the whole band should rush in
while a few secured the servants the rest were to fall upon lord harrowby and his guests
hand grenades were to be thrown into the dining room and during the noise and confusion the assassination of the ministers was to be completed
the heads of lord castlereagh and lord sidmas being carried away in a bag
lord harrowby's dinner party was postponed but the conspirators knew nothing of it
and those who watched his house were further encouraged in their mistake by the arrival of many carriages
bound as it happened to the archbishop of yorke's
meanwhile the main body remained at their headquarters a ruined stable in cato street
edgewar road completing their dispositions for assuming supreme power after the blow had been struck
here they were surprised by the police headed by a magistrate and supported by a strong detachment of her majesty's guards
the police were the first to arrive on the spot the guards having entered the street at the wrong end
the conspirators were in aloft approached by a ladder and a trap door axes through which could only be obtained one by one
the first constable who entered thistlewood ran through the body with a sword but others quickly followed
the lights were extinguished and a desperate conflict ensued
the guards headed by lord adolphus fitz clarence now reinforced the police and the conspirators gave way
nine of the latter were captured with all the war material cutlasshes pistols hand grenades and ammunition
thessle wood and fourteen more succeeded for the moment in making their escape
but most of them were subsequently taken
thistlewood was discovered next morning in a mean house in white street more fields
he was in bed with his breeches on in the pockets of which were found a number of cartridges the black belt he had worn at catos street
and a military sash
the trial of the conspirators came on some six weeks later at the old bailey
thistlewood made a long and rambling defence the chief features of which were abuse of lord sidmoth and the villification of the informer edwards
several of the other prisoners took the same line as regards edwards
and there seems to have been good reason for supposing that he was a greater villain than any of those arraigned
he had been in a state of abject misery and when he first joined the reformers as the cato street conspirators called themselves
he had neither a bed to lie upon nor a coat to his back
his sudden access to means unlimited was no doubt due to the profitable role he soon adopted of government in former and spy
and it is pretty certain that for some time he served both sides
on the one inveigling silly enthusiasts to join in the plot and denouncing them on the other
the employment of edwards and the manner in which the conspirators were allowed to commit themselves further and further before the law was set in motion against them
were not altogether creditable to the government
it was asserted not without foundation at these trials that edwards repeatedly incited the associates he was betraying
to commit outrage to set fire to houses throw hand grenades into the carriages of ministers
that he was to use thistlewood's words a contriver instigator and in trapper
the government were probably not proud of their agent for edwards after the conviction had been assured went abroad to enjoy it was said
an ample pension so long as he did not return to england
five of the conspirators thistlewood ings bront davidson and tid were sentenced to death
and suffered in the usual way in front of newgate with the additional penalty of decapitation as traitors after they had been hanged
a crowd as great as any knome collected in the old bailey to see the ceremony about which there were some peculiar features worth recording
the reckless demeanor of all the convicts except davidson was most market thistlewood and ings sucked oranges on the scaffold
they with brunt and tid scorned the ordinary's ministrations
but ings said he hoped god would be more merciful to him than men had been
hings was especially defiant he sought to cheer davidson who seemed affected crying out
come old cock of wax it will soon be over
as the executioner fastened the noose he nodded to a friend he saw in the crowd
and catching sight of the coffins ranged round the gallows he smiled at the show with contemptuous indifference
he roared out snatches of a song about death or liberty and just before he was turned off
yelled out three cheers to the populace whom he faced
he told the execution or to do it tidy
to pull it tight and was in a state of hysterical exaltation up to the very last
davidson who was the only one who seemed to realize his awful situation listened patiently and with thankfulness to the chaplain
and died in a manner strongly contrasting with that of his fellows
after the five bodies had hung for half an hour a man in a mask came forward to complete the sentence
contemporary report state that from the skilful manner in which he performed the decapitation
he was generally supposed to be a surgeon
be this as it may the weapon used was only an ordinary acts which rather indicates that force not skill was employed
this act is still in existence and is preserved at newgate with various other unpleasant curiosities
but is only an ordinary commonplace tool
these were the last executions for high treason but not the last prisoners by many who passed through newgate charged with sedition
attacx upon the sovereign as i have said became more common after the accession of the young queen victoria in eighteen thirty eight
it was a form of high treason not unknown in earlier reins in seventeen eighty six a mad woman margaret nicholson
tried to stab george the third as he was alighting from his carriage at the gate of saint james's palace
she was seized before she could do any mischief
and eventually lodged in bethlehem hospital where she died after forty years attention at the advanced age of one hundred
again a soldier by name hatfield who had been wounded in the head and discharged from the army for unsoundness of mind
fired a pistol at george the third
from the pit of drury lane theatre in eighteen hundred
william the fourth was also the victim of a murderous outrage on as cut racecourse in eighteen thirty two
when john collins a person in the garb of a sailor of wretched appearance and having a wooden leg
threw a stone at the king which hit him on the forehead but did no serious injury
collins when charged pleaded that he had lost his leg in action
that he had petitioned without success for a pension
and that as he was starving he had resolved on this desperate deed
feeling as he said that he might as well be shot or hanged as remain in such a state
he was eventually sentenced to death but the plea of lunacy was allowed and he was confined for life
none of the foregoing attempts were however so dastardly or determined as that made by oxford upon our present gracious queen
two years after she ascended the throne
the cowardly crime was probably encouraged by the fearless and confiding manner in which the queen
secure as it seemed in the affections of her loyal people freely appeared in public
oxford who was only nineteen at the time his offence was committed had been born at birmingham
but he came as a lad to london and took service as a pot boy to a publican
from this he was promoted to barman and as such had charge of the business in various public houses
he left his last situation in april eighteen forty and established himself in lodgings in lambeth
after which he devoted himself to pistol practice in shooting galleries sometimes in leicster square
sometimes in the strand or the west end
his acquaintances often asked his object in this but he kept his own counsel till the tenth june
on that day oxford was on the watch at buckingham palace
he saw prince albert return there from a visit to woolwich and then passed on to constitution hill
where he waited till four p m the time at which the queen and prince consort usually took an afternoon drive
about six p m the royal carriage a low open vehicle drawn by four horses ridden by postilions left the palace
oxford who had been pacing backwards and forwards with his hands under the lapels of his coat saw the carriage approach
he was on the right or north side of the road prince albert occupied the same side of the carriage the queen the left
as the carriage came up to him oxford turned put his hand into his breast drew a pistol and fired at the queen
the shot missed and as the carriage passed on oxford drew a second pistol and fired again
the queen saw this second movement and stooped to avoid the shot
the prince too rose to shield her with his person again providentially the bullet went wide of the mark
and the royal party drove back to clarenc's house the queen being anxious to give the first news of the outrage and of her safety to her mother
the duchess of kent
meanwhile the pistol shots had attracted the attention of the bystanders of whom there was a fair collection as usual waiting to see the queen pass
oxford was seized by a person named lo who was at first mistaken for the assailant
but oxford at once assumed the responsibility for his crime saying it was i i did it i'll give myself up
there is no occasion to use violence i will go with you
he was taken into custody and removed first to a police cell thence committed to newgate after he had been examined before the privy council
oxford expressed little anxiety or concern
he asked more than once whether the queen was hurt and acknowledged that the pistols were loaded with bull
a craze for notoriety to be achieved at any cost was the one absorbing idea in young oxford's disordered brain
after his arrest he thought only of the excitement his attempt had raised nothing of its atrocity
or of the fatal consequences which might have ensued
when brought to trial he hardly realized his position
but gazed with complacency around the crowded court and eagerly inquired what persons of distinction were present
he smiled continually and when the indictment was red
burst into loud and discordant fits of laughter
these antics may have been assumed to bear up the plea of insanity set up in his defence
but that there was madness in his family and that he himself was of unsound mind could not be well denied
his father it was proved in evidence had been at times quite mad and oxford's mental state might be inferred from his own proceedings
among his papers was found a curious document purporting to be the rules of an association called
young england which oxford had evolved out of his own inflated self conceit and which had never any real corporeal existence
young england was a secret society with no aim or object
its sworn members known only to oxford and all of them mere shadows
were bound to provide themselves with sword rifle dagger and a pair of pistols
to wear a black crape mask to obey punctually the orders of their commander in chief
and to assume any disguise if required to go into the country on the business of the association
the officers of the society were to be known only by factitious names
thus among the presidents were those of gowry justinian alaban coltsman kenneth and godfrey
hannibal and ethelred were on the council anthony augustus and frederick were among the generals
lewis and amadaus among the captains and hercules neptune and mars among the lieutenants of the association
the various grades were distinguished by cockades and bows of different colors
the society was supposed to meet regularly and its proceedings together with the speeches made were duly recorded
with oxford's other papers were found letters from the secretary written as it seemed by oxford to himself after the manner of mister tootes
all of which declared their approval of the commander in chief
one expressed pleasure that oxford improved so much in speaking and declared that his oxford's speech the last time was beautiful
this letter went on to say that a new member had been introduced by lieutenant mars a fine tall gentlemanly young man
and it is said that he is a military officer but his name has not yet transpired
soon after he was introduced we were alarmed by a violent knocking at the door
in an instant our faces were covered we cocked our pistols and with drawn swords stood waiting to receive the enemy
while one stood over the fire with the papers another stood with lighted torch to fire the house
we then sent the old woman to open the door and it proved to be some little boys who had knocked and ran away
another letter directed oxford to attend an extraordinary meeting of young england
in consequence of having received some information of an important nature from hanover
you must attend and if your master will not give you leave you must come in defiance of him
no serious importance could be attached to these the manifest inventions of a disordered intellect
the whole of the evidence pointed so strongly towards insanity that the jury brought in a verdict of acquittal on that ground
and oxford was ordered to be detained during her majesty's pleasure
he went from newgate first to bethlehem from which he was removed to broadmoore on the opening of the great criminal lunatic asylum at that place
he was released from broadmore in eighteen seventy eight and went abroad
within a couple of years a second attempt to assassinate the queen was perpetrated in nearly the same spot by a man named john francis
who was arrested in the very act just as he had fired one shot
his motives for thus imitating the dastardly crime of oxford are shrouded in obscurity
he could not plead insanity like his predecessor and no attempt was made at his trial to prove him of unsound mind
here again probably it was partly the love of notoriety which was the incentive
backed possibly with the hope that as in a much more recent case
he would be in some way provided for he having been for some time previously in abject circumstances
the deed was long premeditated and would have been executed a day earlier had not his courage failed him at the last moment
a youth named pearson had seen him present a pistol at the queen's carriage
but draw it back again exclaiming presently i wish i had done it
pierce and weakly allowed francis to go off without securing his apprehension but later he gave full information
the queen was apprized of the danger and begged not to go abroad
but she declared she would not remain a prisoner in her own palace and next day drove out as usual in an open barouche
nothing happened till her majesty returned to buckingham palace about six p m when on descending constitution hill
with an equerry riding close on each side of her carriage a man who had been leaning against the palace garden wall suddenly advanced
levelled a pistol at the queen and fired he was so close to the carriage that the smoke of his pistol enveloped the face of colonel wilde
one of the equerries the queen was untouched and at first it is said hardly realized the danger she had escaped
francis had already been seized by a policeman named troups who saw his movement with the pistol but too late to prevent its discharge
the prisoner was conveyed without delay to the home office and there examined by the privy council which had been hastily summoned for the purpose
on searching him the pistol was found in his pocket the barrel still warm also some loose powder and a bullet
there was some doubt as to whether the pistol when fired was actually loaded with ball but the jury brought in a verdict off guilty
of the criminal intent to kill
francis was sentenced to be hanged decapitated and quartered
the old traitor's doom but was spared and subsequently transported for life
the enthusiasm of the people at the queen's escape was uproarious and her drive next day was one long triumphal progress
at the italian opera in the evening the audience on the queen's appearance greeted her with loud chears and called for the national anthem
this was in may eighteen forty two
undeterred by the well merited punishment which had overtaken francis
a third miscreant made a similar but far less serious attempt in the month of july following
as the queen was driving from buckingham palace to the chapel royal
a deformed lad among the crowd was seen to present a pistol at her majesty's carriage
in the mole about half way between buckingham and saint james's palaces
only one person saw the movement a lad named dassett who had once collared the cripple and taking him up to two policemen
charged him with the offence
the policeman treated the matter as a hoax and allowed the culprit to make off
later on however dasset was himself seized and interrogated
and on his information handbills were circulated giving the exact description of the deformed youth who had a hump back
and a long sickly pale face with light hair
his nose was marked with a scar or black patch and he was altogether of a dirty appearance
it happened that a lad named bean had absconded from his father's home some weeks before
whose description as given by his father to the police
exactly tallied with that of the deformed person wanted for the assault on the queen
a visit to the father's residence was followed by the arrest of the son who had by this time returned
this son john william bean was fully identified by dacet and presently examined by the privy council
he was eventually charged with a misdemeanour the capital charge having been abandoned and committed for trial
much the same motives of seeking notoriety seemed to have impelled being who was perfectly sane to his rash act
but it was proved that the pistol was not loaded with ball
and he was only convicted of an attempt to harass vex and grieve the sovereign
lord avinger sentenced him to eighteen months imprisonment in newgate
but the place of durance was changed to meet the existing law to millbank penitentiary
i shall mention briefly one more case in which however there was no murderous intent before i pass on to other crimes
on june eighteen fifty the queen was once more subjected to cowardly outrage the offender being a mister pate a gentleman by birth
who had borne the queen's commission first as cornet and then lieutenant
in the tent hussars
pate was said to be an eccentric person given to strange acts and antics
such as mixing whiskey and camphor with his morning bathwater
and walking for choice through prickly gorse bushes
he always kept the blinds down at his chambers in jermyn street and as the saint james clock chimed quarter past three
invariably went out in a cab for which he always paid the same fare
nine shillings all in shillings and no other coin
but this was not sufficient to constitute lunacy nor was his plea of momentary uncontrollable impulse
deemed valid as any palliation of his offence
that offence was a brutal assault upon her majesty whom he struck in the face with a small stick just as she was leaving cambridge house
the blow crushed the bonnet and bruised the forehead of the queen who was happily not otherwise injured
pate was found guilty and sentenced to seven years transportation the judge baron alderson abstaining from inflicting the penalty of whipping
which was authorized by a recent act on account of mister pate's family in position in life
i have already remarked that as violence was more and more eliminated from crimes against the person
frauds indicating great boldness extensive design and ingenuity became more prevalent
the increase of bank forgeries and its cause are referred to in a previous chapter
at one session of the old bailey in eighteen twenty one no less than thirty five true bills were found for passing forge notes
but there were other notorious cases of forgery
that of faunt le roy the banker in eighteen twenty four
caused much excitement at the time on account of the magnitude of the fraud and the seeming probity of the culprit
mister fauntleroy was a member of a banking firm which his father had established in conjunction with a gentleman of the name of marsh and others
he had entered the house as clerk in eighteen hundred
in eighteen o seven and when only twenty two he succeeded to his father's share in the business
according to faunt le roy's own case he found at once that the firm was heavily involved
through advances made to various builders and that it could only maintain its credit by wholesale discounting
its embarrassments were greatly increased by the bankruptcy of two of its clients in the building trade
and the bank became liable for a sum of one hundred seventy thousand pounds
new liabilities were incurred to the extent of one hundred thousand pounds by more failures and in eighteen nineteen
by the death of one of the partners a large sum in cash had to be withdrawn from the bank to pay his heirs
during these numerous and trying difficulties it is mister fauntleroy who speaks
the house was nearly without resources and the whole burthen of management falling on me i sought resources where i could
in other words he forged powers of attorney and proceeded to realize securities lodged in his bank under various names
among the prisoners private papers one was found giving full details of the stock he had feloniously sold out
the sum total amounting to some one hundred seventy thousand pounds with a declaration in his own handwriting to the following effect
in order to keep up the credit of our house i have forged powers of attorney for the above sums and parties
and sold out to the amount here stated and without the knowledge of my partners
i kept up the payments of the dividends but made no entries of such payments in my books
the bank began first to refuse our acceptances and to destroy the credit of our house the bank shall smart for it
the chronicles of newgate volume two by arthur griffith's section fourteen newgate notorieties part one
many stories were in circulation at the time of fauntleroy's trial with regard to his forgeries it was said that he had by means of them
sold out so large an amount of stock that he paid sixteen thousand pounds a year in dividends to escape detection
once he ran a narrow risk of being found out
a lady in the country who had thirteen thousand pounds in the stocks desired her london agent to sell them out
he went to the bank and found that no stalks stood in her name he called at once upon faunt le roy his client's bankers for an explanation
and was told by mister frountleroy that the lady had desired him to sell out which i have done added the fraudulent banker and here are the proceeds
whereupon he produced exchequer bills to the amount
nothing more was heard of the affair although the lady declared that she had never instructed fauntleroy to sell
on another occasion the banker forged a gentleman's name while the latter was sitting with him in his private room
and took the instrument out to a clerk with the ink not dry
it must be added that the bank of england on discovering the forgeries
replaced the stock in the names of the original holders who might otherwise have been completely ruined
a newspaper report of the time describes frontle roy as a well made man of middle stature
his hair though grey was thick and lay smooth over his forehead
his countenance had an expression of the most subdued resignation
the impression which his appearance altogether was calculated to make was that of the profoundest commiseration
the crime long carried on without detection was first discovered in eighteen twenty
when it was found that a sum of ten thousand pounds standing in the name of three trustees of whom fauntleroy was one
had been sold out under a forged power of attorney
further investigations brought other similar frauds to light
and fixed the whole sum misappropriated at a hundred seventy thousand pounds the first forgery dating back to eighteen fourteen
a run upon the bank immediately followed which was only met by a suspension of payment and the closing of its doors
meanwhile public gossip was busy with fauntleroy's name
and it was openly stated in the press and in conversation that the proceeds of these frauds had been squandered in chambering gambling and debauchery
falntle roy was scouted as a licentious libertine a deep and determined gamester a spendthrift whose extravagance knew no bounds
the veil was lifted from his private life and he was accused of persistent immorality
in his defence
he sought to rebut these charges which indeed were never clearly made out and it is pretty certain that his own account of the causes which led him into dishonesty
was substantially true
he called many witnesses seventeen in all
to speak of him as they had found him
and these all respectable city merchants and business men
declared that they had hitherto formed a high opinion of his honour integrity and goodness of disposition
deeming him the last person capable of a dishonorable action
these arguments availed little with the jury who after a short deliberation found fantleroy guilty and he was sentenced to death
every endeavour was used however to obtain a commutation of sentence his case was twice argued before the judges on points of law
but the result in both cases was unfavorable
appeals were made to the home secretary and all possible political interest brought to bear but without success
fauntleroy meanwhile lay in newgate not herded with other condemned prisoners as the custom was
but in a separate chamber that belonging to one of the warders of the jail
i find in the chaplain's journal under date eighteen twenty four various entries relative to this prisoner
visited mister fauntleroy my application for books for him not having been attended i had no prayer book to give him
visited mister fantleroy the sheriffs have very kindly permitted him to remain in the turnkeys room where he was originally placed nor can i omit expressing a hope
that this may prove the beginning of a better system of confinement and that every description of persons who may be unfortunately under sentence of death
will no longer be herded indiscriminately together
the kindliness of the city authorities to fantleroy was not limited to the assignment of a separate place of durance
as i have already said they took the chaplain seriously to task for the bad taste shown in the condemned sermon preached before fauntleroy
this was on the text
wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall and was full of the most pointed allusions to the culprit
faunt le roy constantly groaned aloud while the sermon proceeded and contemporary reports declared
that he appeared to feel deeply the force of the reverend gentleman's observations especially when the chaplain spoke of
the great magnitude of our erring brothers offence one of the most dangerous description in a trading community
the sermon ended with an appeal to the dying man exhorting him to penitence
this personality and it can be called by no other name
is carefully excluded from prison pulpit utterances on the eve of an execution
a very curious and in its way amusing circumstance in connection with this case was the offer of a certain italian
edmund angellini to take fraunt le roy's place
and gellini wrote to the lord mayor to this effect
urging that faunt le roy was a father a citizen his life is useful mine a burthen to the state
he was summoned to the mansion house where he repeated his request crying
a corde was set the glass with much urgency
there were doubts of husanity
he wrote afterwards to the effect that the moment he had offered himself an unknown assassin came to aim a blow at him
let this monster give his name i am ready to fight him i am still determined to put myself in the place of mister fauntleroy
if the law of this country can receive such a sacrifice my death will render to heaven an innocent man and to earth a repentant sinner
faunt le roy was not entirely dependent upon the ordinary for ghostly counsel in his extremity
he was also attended by the reverend mister springet and the indefatigable mister baker whose name has already been mentioned
when led out on the morning of his execution these two last named gentlemen each took hold of one of his arms and so accompanied him to the scaffold
ta concourse in front of newgate was enormous but much sympathy was evinced for this unfortunate victim to human weakness and ruthless laws
a report was moreover widely circulated and the impression long prevailed that he actually escaped death
it was said that strangulation had been prevented by the insertion of a silver cube in his windpipe
and that after hanging for the regulated time he was taken down and easily restored to consciousness
afterwards according to the common rumor he went abroad and lived there for many years but the story is not only wholly unsubstantiated
but there is good evidence to show that the body after execution was handed over to his friends and interred privately
some years were still to elapse before capital punishment ceased to be the penalty for forgery and in the interval
several persons were sentenced to or suffered death for this crime
there were two notable capital convictions for forgery in eighteen twenty eight
one was that of captain montgomery who assumed the aliases of colonel wallace and colonel morgan
his offence was uttering forged notes and there was strong suspicion that he had long subsisted entirely by this fraud
the act for which he was taken into custody was the payment of a forge ten pound note for half a dozen silver spoons
montgomery was an adeptav forgery he had gone wrong early although born of respectable parents and gazetted to a commission in the army
he soon left the service and betook himself to dishonest ways
his first forgery was the marvellous imitation of the signature of the hon mister neville m p who wrote an extremely cramped and curious hand
he was not prosecuted for this fraud on account of the respectability of his family and soon after this escape
he came to london where he practised as a professional swindler and cheat
for a long time justice did not overtake him for any criminal offence but he was frequently in newgate and the king's bench for debt
after three years confinement in the latter prison he passed himself off as his brother colonel montgomery
a distinguished officer and would have married an heiress had not the imposture been discovered in time
he then took to forging bank notes and was arrested as i have described above
montgomery was duly sentenced to death but he preferred suicide to the gallows after sentence his demeanor was serious yet firm
the night previous to that fixed for his execution he wrote several letters one of them being to edward gibbon wakefield a fellow prisoner
and listened attentively to the ordinary who read him the well known address written and delivered by doctor dodd previous to his own execution for forgery
but next morning he was found dead in his cell
in one corner after much search a file was found labelled prussic acid
which it was asserted he had been in the habit of carrying about his person ever since he had taken to passing forged notes as an antidote against disgrace
this file he had managed to retain in his possession in spite of the frequent searches to which he was subjected in newgate
the second conviction for forgery in eighteen twenty eight was that of the quaker joseph hunted a man of previously the highest repute in the city of london
he had prospered in early life was a slop cellar on a large scale at buryson edmunds and a sugar baker in the metropolis
he married a lady also belonging to the society of friends who brought him a large fortune which and his own money he put into a city firm
that of dixon in company
he soon however became deeply involved in stock exchange speculations
and losing heavily to meet the claims upon him he put out a number of forged bills of exchange or acceptances
to which the signature of one wilkins of abingdon was found to be forged
hunton tried to fly the country on the detection of the fraud but was arrested at plymouth just as he was on the point of leaving england in the new york packet
he had gone on board in his quaker dress but when captured was found in a light green frock
a pair of light gray pantaloons a black stalk and a foraging cat
hunton was put upon his trial at the old bailey and in due course sentenced to death
his defence was that the forged acceptances would have been met on coming to maturity and that he had no real desire to defraud
hunton accepted his sentence with great resignation although he protested against the inhumanity of the laws which condemned him to death
on entering newgate he said
i wish after this day to have communication with nobody let me take leave of my wife and family and friends i have already suffered an execution
my heart has undergone that horrible penalty
he was however visited by and received his wife and several members of the society of friends
two elders of the meeting sat up with him in the press yard the whole of the night previous to execution and a third
mister sparks moleen came to attend him to the scaffold
he met his death with unshaken firmness only entreating that a certain blue handkerchief
to which he seemed fondly attached should be used to bandage his eyes which request was readily granted
hunton's execution no doubt aroused public attention to the cruelty and futility of the capital law against forgery
a society which had already been started against capital punishment
devoted its efforts first to a mitigation of the forgery statute but could not immediately accomplish much
in eighteen twenty nine the gallows claimed two more victims for this offence
one was richard gifford a well educated youth who had been at christ's hospital and afterwards in the national debt office
unfortunately he took to drink lost his appointment and fell from bad to worse
suddenly after being at the lowest depths he emerged and was found by his friends living in comfort in the waterloo road
his funds which he pretended came to him with a rich wife were really the proceeds of frauds upon the bank of england
he forged the names of people who held stock on the bank books and got the value of the stock
he also forged dividend receipts and got the dividends he was only six and twenty when he was hanged
the other and the last criminal executed for forgery in this country was one maynard who was convicted of a fraud upon the custom house
in conjunction with two others one of whom was a clerk in the custom house
and had access to the official records he forged a warrant for one thousand nine hundred seventy three pounds and was paid the money by the controller general
maynard was convicted of uttering the forge document jones of being an accessory the third prisoner was acquitted
maynard was the only one who suffered death
this was on the last day of eighteen twenty nine in the following session sir robert peel brought in a bill to consolidate the acts relating to forgery
upon the third reading of this bill sir james mackintosh moved as an amendment that capital punishment should be abolished for all crimes of forgery
except the forgery of wills and powers of attorney
this amendment was strongly supported outside the house and a petition in favor of its passing was presented
signed by more than a thousand members of banking firms
mackintosh's amendment was carried in the commons but the new law did not pass the lords who reenacted the capital penalty
still no sentence of death was carried out for the offence and in eighteen thirty two
the attorney general introduced a bill to abolish capital punishment entirely for forgery
it passed the commons but opposition was again encountered in the lords
this time they sent back the bill reenacting only the two penalties for will forging and the forging of powers of attorney
in other words they had advanced in eighteen thirty two to the point at which the lower house had arrived in eighteen thirty
there were at the moment in newgate six convicts sentenced to death for forging wills
the question was whether the government would dare to take their lives at the bidding of the house of lords
and in defiance of the vote of the assembly which more accurately represented public opinion it was indeed announced that their fate was sealed
but mister joseph hume pressed the government hard and obtained an assurance that the men should not be executed
the new forgery act with the lord's amendment passed into law but the latter proved perfectly harmless
and no person ever after suffered death for any variety of this crime
i will include in this part of the present chapter almost one of the last instances of a crime which in time passed
had invariably been visited with the death penalty and which was of a distinctly fraudulent nature
the abduction of miss turner by the brothers wakefield bore a strong resemblance to the carrying off and forcible marrying of heiresses as already described
miss turner was a schoolgirl of barely fifteen
only child of a gentleman of large property in cheshire of which county he was actually high sheriff at the time of his daughter's abduction
the elder brother
edward gibbon wakefield the prime mover in the abduction was a barrister not exactly briefless but without a large practice
he had it was said a good private income and was already a widower with two children at the time of his committing the offence for which he was subsequently tried
he had eloped with his first wife from school
while on a visit to mackelsfield he heard by chance of miss turner and that she would inherit all her father's possessions
he thereupon conceived an idea of carrying her off and marrying her willy nilly at gredna green
the two brothers started at once for liverpool where miss turner was at school with a missus dollby
at manchester on a rout a travelling carriage was purchased which was driven up to missus dalby's door at eight in the morning
and a servant hurriedly alighted from it bearing a letter for miss turner
this purported to be from the medical attendant of mister turner written at shrigly mister turner's place of residence
and it stated that missus turner had been stricken with paralysis
she was not in immediate danger but she wished to see her daughter as it was possible she might soon become incapable of recognizing any one
miss turner greatly agitated accompanied the messenger who had brought this news a disguised servant of wake fields
who had plausibly explained that he had only recently been engaged at shrigly
the road taken was via manchester where the servants said a doctor hall was to be picked up to go on with them to shrigly
at manchester however the carriage stopped at the albion hotel
miss turner was shown into a private room where mister wakefield soon presented himself
miss turner not knowing him would have left the room but he said he came from her father and she remained
wakefield in reply to her inquiries satisfied her that her mother was well and that the real reason for summoning her from school
was the state of her father's affairs
mister turner was on the verge of bankruptcy he was at that moment at kendall and wished her to join him there at once
miss turner consented to go on and they travelled night and day towards the north
but at kendall there was no mister turner and to allay miss turner's growing anxiety
wakefield found it necessary to become more explicit regarding her father's affairs
he now pretended that mister turner was also on his way to the border pursued by sheriff's officers
the fact was wakfield went on to say an uncle of his had advanced mister turner sixty thousand pounds which had temporarily staved off ruin
but another bank had since failed and nothing could save mister turner but the transfer of some property to miss turner and its settlement on her
so that it might become the exclusive property of her husband whoever he might be
wakefield added that it had been suggested he should marry miss turner but that he had laughed at the idea
wakefield's uncle took the matter more seriously and declare that unless the marriage came off mister turner must be sold up
miss turner thus pressed consented to go on to gretna green
passing through carlyle she was told that mister turner was in the town but could not show himself
nothing could release him from his trouble but the arrival of the marriage certificate from gretna green
filial affection rose superior to all scruples and miss turner having crossed the border was married to wikfield
by the blacksmith in the usual way
returning to carlysle she now heard that her father had been set free and had gone home to shrigly whither they were to follow him
they set out but at leads wakefield found himself called suddenly to paris
the other brother was accordingly sent on a pretended mission to shrigly to bring mister turner on to london whither wakefield and miss turner also proceeded
on arrival wakfield pretended that they had missed mister turner and must follow him over to france
the strangely married couple thereupon pressed on to dover and crossed over to calais
the fact of the abduction did not transpire for some days
then missus dalby learnt that miss turner had not arrived at shrikly but that she had gone to manchester
friends went in pursuit and traced her to hutter's field and further north
the terror and dismay of her parents were soon intensified by the receipt of a letter from wakefield at carlisle announcing the marriage
mister turner at once set off for london
where he sought the assistance of the police
and presently ascertained that wakefield had gone to the continent with his involuntary bride
an uncle of miss wakefield's accompanied by his solicitor and a bow street runner at once went in pursuit
meanwhile a second letter turned up from wakfield at calais in which he assured missus turner that miss turner was fondly attached to him
and went on to say i do assure you madam that it shall be the anxious endeavour of my life to promote her happiness by every means in my power
the game however was nearly up miss turner was met by her uncle aun calais pier as she was walking with wakefield
the uncle claimed her the husband resisted
monsieur le maire was appealed to and decided to leave it to the young lady who at once abandoned wakefield
as he still urged his rights over his wife miss turner cried out in protest no no i am not his wife
he carried me away by fraud and stratagem and forced me to accompany him to gretna green
by the same forcible means i was compelled to quit england and to trust myself to the protection of this person
whom i never saw until i was taken from liverpool and never want to see again
on this wakefield gave in
he surrendered the bride who had never been a wife and she returned to england with her friends while wakefield went on alone to paris
mister william witfield was arrested at dover conveyed to chester and committed to lancaster jail for trial at the next assizes
when indictments were preferred against both brothers for having carried away ellen turner spinster
then a maid and heir apparent unto her father for the sake of the lucre of her substance and for having afterwards unlawfully and against her will
married the said ellen turner
they were tried in march of the following year edward watefield having apparently given himself up
and found guilty remaining in lancaster jail for a couple of months when they were brought up to the court of king's bench for judgment
the prosecution pressed for a severe penalty
edward wakefield pleaded that his trial had already cost him three thousand pounds
mister justice bailey in summing up
spoke severely of the gross deception practised upon an innocent girl and sentenced the brothers each to three years imprisonment
william witefield and lancaster jail and edward gibbon wakefield in newgate which sentences were duly enforced
the marriage was annulled by an act of parliament although wakefield petitioned against it
and was brought from newgate at his own request to oppose the second reading of the bill
he also wrote and published a pamphlet from the jail to show that miss turner had been a consenting party to the marriage and was really his wife
neither his address nor his pamphlet availed much for the bill for the divorce passed both houses
that mister witkfield was a shrewd critic and close observer of all that went on in the newgate of those days
will be admitted by those who have read his book on the punishment of death
which was based on his jail experiences and of which i have availed myself in the last chapter
after their release from lancaster in newgate respectively both wikfields went abroad
mister w wakefield served in a continental army and rose to the rank of colonel
after which he went to new zealand and held an important post in that colony
mister e g wakefield took part in the scheme for the colonization of north australia and for some years resided in that colony
miss turner subsequently married mister legg of limb hall cheshire
it must not be imagined that although highway robbery was now nearly extinct and felonious outrages in the streets were rare
that thieves or depreditors were idle or entirely unsuccessful
bigger jobs than ever were planned and attempted
as in the burglary at lambeth palace when the thieves were fortunately disappointed the archbishop having before he left town
sent his plate chests eight in number to the silversmiths for greater security
the jewellers were always a favorite prey of the london thieves
shops were broken into as when that of grimauldi and johnson in the strand was robbed of watches to the value of six thousand pounds
where robbery with violence was intended the perpetrators had now to adopt various shifts and contrivances to secure their victim
no more curious instance of this ever occurred than the assault made by one howard upon a mister molay with intent to rob him
the latter had advertised offering a sum of one thousand pounds to any one who would introduce him to some mercantile equipment
howard replied desiring mister malay to call upon him in a house in red lions square
mister malay went and a second interview was agreed upon when a third person mister owen
through whose interest and appointment under government was to be obtained for mallee would be present
mister malay called again taking with him five hundred pounds in cash howard discovered this and his manner was very suspicious
there were weapons in the room a long knife a heavy track bull bat and a poker
mister malay became alarmed and as mister owen did not appear withdrew
howard strange to say making no attempt to detain him probably because milet promised to return a few days later and to bring more money
on this renewed visit mister owen was still absent and mister maley agreed to write him a note from a copy howard gave him
while tus engaged howard thrust the poker into the fire
molay protested and then howard under the influence of ungovernable rage as it seemed jumped up
locked the door and attacked mila violently with the tracp ball bat and knice
malay defended himself and managed to break the knife but not before he had cut himself severely
a life and death struggle ensued malay cried murder
howard swore he would finish him but proved the weaker of the two and melay got him down on the floor
by this time the neighbors were aroused and several people came to the scene of the affray
howard was secured given into custody and committed to newgate
the defense he set up was that molay had used epithets towards him while they were negotiating a business matter
and that being an irritable temper he had struck meley after which a violent scuffle took place
it was however proved that howard was in needy circumstances and that his proposals to mister malay could only have originated in a desire to rob him
he was found guilty of an assault with intent and sentence to transportation for fourteen years
are more complicated and altogether most extraordinary case of assault with intent to extort money occurred a few years later
it was perpetrated upon a respectable country solicitor
mister g of bishop stortford who administered the estate of a certain mister canning deceased
this mister canning had left his widow a life interest in two thousand pounds so long as she remained unmarried
the money went after her to her children
mister g had invested one thousand two hundred pounds of this and was seeking how best to place the remaining eight hundred pounds
when he was asked to meet a mister heath in london with regard to the sale of certain lands at bishop stortford
an appointment was made and kept by mister g
but on arrival he was met by a young sailor with a letter which begged mister g to go to heath's house as the latter was not well
mister j went in the coach sent for him and alighted at twenty seven york street west commercial road
the coach immediately drove off mister g entered the house asked for mister heath was told he would find him in the back kitchen at breakfast
he was about to descend the stairs when three persons one of them the young sailor
fell upon him and in spite of his resistance carried him into a sort of din partitioned off at the end of the back kitchen
there he was seated on some sort of wooden bench and securely fastened
a chain fixed to staples at his back passed round his chest under his arms and was padlocked on the left side
his feet were bound with cords and made fast to rings in the floor thus manacled one of the party who pretended to be missus canning's brother
addressed him insisting that he should forthwith sign a checque for the eight hundred pounds of the canning inheritance still uninvested
and write in order sufficient to secure the surrender of the other one thousand two hundred pounds
mister g at first stoutly refused
then as they warned him that he would be kept a prisoner in total darkness in this horrible den until he agreed to their demands
he gave in and signed the documents thus illegally extorted
one was a check for eight hundred pounds on his bankers the other an order to mister bell of newport essex requesting the surrender of a deed
his captors having thus succeeded in their designs left him no doubt to realize the money
the door of his place of durrance stood open and mister g began to consider whether he might not escape
for three hours he struggled without success with his bonds
but at length managed to wriggle out of the chain which confined his body and soon loosened the ropes round his feet
thus free he eluded the vigilance of two of the party who were at dinner in the front kitchen
and creeping out into the garden at the back climbed the wool and got into the street
his first act was to send a messenger to stop the check and the order to mister bell his next to seek the help of the police
two bow street runners were despatched to the house in york street which had evidently been taken on purpose for the outrage
there was no furniture in the place and the den in the kitchen had been recently and specially constructed of boards of immense strength and thickness
it was a cell five feet by three within another the intervening being filled with rammed earth to deaden the sound
the chronicles of newgate volume two by arthur griffith's section fifteen newgate notorieties part three
on the arrival of the police the house was empty
two men on guard had gone off immediately after mister g had escaped but they returned later in the day and were apprehended
inquiries set on foot also elicited the suspicion that the person who had represented missus canning's brother
was a blind man named edwards who had taken this house in york street and who was known to be a frequent visitor at missus canning's
a watch was set on him at her house where he was soon afterwards arrested
edwards whom mister g easily identified with the others at once admitted that he was the prime mover of the conspiracy
he had sought by all legal means to obtain possession of the two thousand pounds but had failed
and had had recourse to more violent means
it turned out that he was really married to missus canning
both having been recognized by the clergyman who had performed the ceremony and the assault had been committed to secure the money
which missus canning had lost by remarriage
all three men were committed for trial although edwards wished to exculpate the others as having only acted under his order
at the trial the indictment charging them with felony could not be sustained but they were found guilty of conspiracy and assault
edwards was sentenced to two years imprisonment in newgate
weden and lacassar to twelve and six months respectively in cold bath fields
at no period could thieves in london or elsewhere have prospered had they been unable to dispose of their ill gotten goods
the trade of fence or receiver therefore is very nearly as old as the crimes which had so obviously fostered
one of the most notorious and for a time most successful practitioners in this illicit trade passed through newgate in eighteen thirty one
the name of ikey solomons was long remembered by thief and thief taker
he began as an itinerant street vender at eight at ten he passed bad money
at fourteen he was a pickpocket and a duffer or a cellar of sham goods
he early saw the profits to be made out of purchasing stolen goods but could not embark in it at first for want of capital
he was taken up when still in his teens for stealing a pocket book and was sentenced to transportation but did not get beyond the hulks at chatham
on his release an uncle a slop cellar in chatham gave him a situation as barker or salesman
at which he realized one hundred fifty pounds within a couple of years
with this capital he returned to london and set up as a fence
he had such great aptitude for business and such a thorough knowledge of the real value of goods
that he was soon admitted to be one of the best judges known of all kinds of property from a glass bottle to a five hundred guinea chronometer
but he never paid more than a fixed price for all articles of the same class whatever their intrinsic value
thus a watch was paid for as a watch whether it was of gold or silver
a piece of linen as such whether the stuff was coarse or fine
this rule in dealing with stolen goods continues to this day and has made the fortune of many since iky
solomon's also established a system of provincial agency by which stolen goods were passed on from london to the seaports and so abroad
jewels were reset
diamonds refaced all marks by which other articles might be identified the selvages of linen the stamps on shoes
the number and names on watches were carefully removed or obliterated after the goods passed out of his hands
on one occasion the whole of the proceeds of a robbery from a boot shop was traced to solomon's
the owner came with the police and was morally convinced that it was his property
but could not positively identify it and ikey defied them to remove a single shoe
in the end the injured boot maker agreed to buy back his stolen stock
at the price solomons had paid for it and it cost him about a hundred pounds to restock his shop with his own goods
as a general rule ikey solomons confined his purchases to small articles mostly of jewelery and plate
which he kept concealed in a hiding place with a trap door just under his bed
he lived in rosemary lane and sometimes he had as much as twenty thousand pounds worth of goods secreted on the premises
when his trade was busiest he set up a second establishment at the head of which although he was married
he put another lady with whom he was on intimate terms
the second house was in lower queen street islington and he used it for some time as a depot for valuables
but it was eventually discovered by missus solomon's a very jealous wife
and this with the danger arising from an extensive robbery of watches in cheapside
in which ikey was implicated as a receiver
led him to think seriously of trying his fortunes in another land
he was about to emigrate to new south wales when he was arrested at islington and committed two newgate on a charge of receiving stolen goods
while thus incarcerated he managed to escape from custody but not actually from jail by an ingenious contrivance which is worth mentioning
he claimed to be admitted to bale and was taken from newgate on a writ of habeus before one of the judges sitting at westminster
he was conveyed in a coach driven by a confederate and under the escort of a couple of turnkeys
solomons while waiting to appear in court persuaded the turnkeys to take him to a public house where all might refresh
while there he was joined by his wife and other friends
after a short carouse the prisoner went into westminster his case was heard bale refused and he was ordered back to newgate
but he once more persuaded the turnkeys to pause at the public where more liquor was consumed
when the journey was resumed missus solomons accompanied her husband in the coach
halfway to newgate she was taken with a fit
one turnkey was stupidly drunk and ikey persuaded the other who was not much better
to let the coach change and pass petticoat lane on root to the jail where the suffering woman might be handed over to her friends
on stopping at a door in this low street ikey jumped out ran into the house slamming the door behind him
he passed through and out at the back and was soon beyond pursuit
by and by the turnkeys sobered by their loss returned to newgate alone and pleaded in excuse that they had been drugged
ike left no traces and the police could hear nothing of him he had in fact gone out of the country to copenhagen whence he passed on to new york
there he devoted himself to the circulation of forged notes he was also anxious to do business in watches
and begged his wife to send him over a consignment of cheap righteous watches or such as had been honestly obtained and not on the cross
but missus solomons could not resist the temptation to dabble in stolen goods
and she was found shipping watches of the wrong category to new york
for this she received a sentence of fourteen years transportation and was sent to van diemen's land
ikkey joined her at hobart town where they set up a general's shock and soon began to prosper
he was however recognized and ere long an order came out from home for his arrest and transfer to england
which presently followed and again found himself an inmate of newgate waiting trial as a receiver and a prison breaker
he was indicted on eight charges two only of which were substantiated but on each of them he received a sentence of seven years transportation
at his own request he was re conveyed to hobart town where his son had been carrying on the business
whether ikey was assigned to his own family is not recorded but no doubt he succeeded to his own property when the term of servitude had expired
no doubt on the removal of iky solomons from the scene his mantle fell upon worthy successors
there was an increase rather than an abatement in jewel and bullion robberies in the years immediately following
and the thieves seemed to have had no difficulty in disposing of their spoil
one of the largest robberies of its class was that effected upon the custom house in the winter of eighteen thirty four
a large amount of specie was nearly always retained here in the department of the receiver of fines
this was known to some clerks in the office who began to consider how they might lay hands on a lot of cash
being inexperienced they decided to call in the services of a couple of professional housebreakers
jordan and sullivan who at once set to work in a businesslike way to obtain impressions of the keys of the strong room and chest
but before committing themselves to an attempt on the latter it was of importance to ascertain how much it usually contained
for this purpose jordan waited on the receiver to make a small payment for which he tendered a fifty pound note
the chest was opened to give change and a heavy tray lifted out which plainly held some four thousand pounds in cash
some difficulty then arose as to gaining admission to the strong room and it was arranged that a man may another custom house clerk
it should be introduced into the building and secreted there during the night to accomplish the robbery
may was smuggled in through a window on the esplanade behind an opened umbrella when the place was quite deserted
he broke open the chest and stole four thousand seven hundred pounds in notes with a quantity of gold and some silver
he went out next morning with the booty when the doors were reopened and attracted no attention
the spoil was fairly divided part of the notes were disposed of to a travelling receiver who passed over to the continent and there cashed them easily
this occurred in november eighteen thirty four the custom house officials were in a state of consternation
and the police were unable at first to get on the track of the thiebes
while the excitement was still fresh a new robbery of diamonds was committed at a bonded warehouse in the immediate neighbourhood on custom house quay
the jewels had belonged to a spanish countess recently deceased who had sent them to england for greater security on the outbreak of the first carlist war
at her death the diamonds were divided between her four daughters but only half had been claimed
and at the time of the robbery there were still six thousand pounds worth in the warehouse
these were deposited in an iron chest of great strength on the second floor
the thieves it was supposed had secreted themselves in the warehouse during business hours and waited till night to carry out their plans
some ham sandwiches several cigar ends and two empty champagne bottles were found on the premises next day showing how they had passed their time
they had had serious work to get at the diamonds it was necessary to force one heavy door from its hinges and to cut through the thick panels of another
the lock and fastenings of the chest were forced by means of a jack an instrument known two housebreakers
which if introduced into a keyhole and worked like a bit and brace will soon destroy the strongest lock
the thieves were satisfied with the diamonds they broke open other cases containing gold watches and plate but abstracted nothing
the police were of the opinion that these robberies were both the work of the same hand
but it was not until the autumn that they traced some of the notes stolen from the custom house to jordan and sullivan
about this time also suspicion fell upon hughie one of the clerks who was arrested soon afterwards and made a clean breast of the whole affair
there was a hunt for the two well known housebreakers who were eventually heard of at a lodging in tending to
but they at once made tracks and took up their residence under assumed names in a tavern in bloomsbury
the police lost all trace of them for some days but at length sullivan's brother was followed from the house in kennington to the above mentioned tavern
both the thieves were now apprehended but only a small portion of the lost property was recovered
notwithstanding a minute search through the room they had occupied
after their arrest jordan's wife and sullivan's brother came to the inn and begged to be allowed to visit this room
but their request in spite of their earnest entreaties
was refused at the instigation of the police a few days later a frequent guest at the tavern arrived and had this same room allotted to him
a fire was lit in it and the maiden doing so through a lot of rubbish as it seemed which had accumulated under the grate on top of the burning coals
by and by the occupant of the room noticed something glittering in the centre of the fire which to inspect more closely he took out with the tongs
it was a large gold brooch set in pearls but a portion of the mountain had melted with the heat
the fire was raked out
and in the ashes were found seven large and four dozen small brilliants also seven emeralds
one of them of considerable size
a part of the swag stolen from the bonded warehouse was thus recovered but it was supposed that a number of the stolen notes had perished in the fire
the condigned punishment meeted out to these custom house robbers had no deterrint effect seemingly
within three months three new and most mysterious burglaries were committed at the west end all in houses adjoining each other
one was occupied by the portuguese ambassador who lost a quantity of jewelery from an escratoire and his neighbors lost plate and cash
at the slightest clew to these large affairs was ever obtained but it is probable that they were put up jobs or managed with the complicity of servants
the next year twelve thousand sovereigns were cleverly stolen in the mile end road
the gold dust robbery of eighteen thirty nine the first of its kind was cleverly and carefully planned with the assistance of a dishonest employ
a young man named caspar clark to a steamship company
learnt through the firm's correspondence that a quantity of gold dust
brought in a man of war from brazil had been transshipped at falmouth for conveyance to london
the letter informed him of the marks and sizes of the cases containing the precious metal
and he with his father arranged that a messenger should call for the stuff with forged credentials and anticipating the rightful owner
the fraudulent messenger by the help of young caspar established his claim to the boxes paid the horfage dews and carried off the gold dust
presently the proper person arrived from the consines but found the gold dust gone
the police were at once employed and after infinite pains they discovered the person one moss who had acted as the messenger
moss was known to be intimate with the elder caspar
father of the clerk to the steamship company and these facts were deemed sufficient to justify the arrest of all three
they also ascertained that a gold refiner
solomon's had sold bargold to the value of one thousand two hundred pounds to certain bullion dealers
solomon's was not straightforward in his replies as to where he got the gold and he was soon placed in the dock with the caspers and moss
moss presently turned approver
and implicated money moses another jew for the whole affair had been planned and executed by members of the hebrew persuasion
money moses had received the stolen gold dust from moss's father in law davis or isaacs who was never arrested
and passed it on to solomon's by his daughter a widow named abraham's
solomon's was now also admitted as a witness and his evidence with that of moss secured the transportation of the principal actors in the theft
in the course of the trial it came out that almost every one concerned except the caspers had endeavored to defraud his accomplices
moss peached because he declared he had been done out of the proper price of the gold dust but it was clear that he had tried to appropriate the whole of the stuff
instead of handing it or the price of it back to the caspers
money moses and missus abraham's imposed upon moss as to the price paid by solomons
missus abraham's imposed upon her father by abstracting a portion of the dust and selling it on her own account
solomons cheated the whole lot by retaining half the gold in his possession and only giving an iou for it
which he refused to redeem on account of the row about the robbery
moses it may be added was a direct descendant of iky solomons
he was ostensibly a publican
and kept the black lion in vinegar yard drury lane where secretly he did business as one of the most daring and successful fencers ever known in the metropolis
his arrest and conviction cast dismay over the whole gang of receivers and for a time seriously checked than a farious traffic
it may be added that prison life did not agree with the money moses a striking change came over his appearance while in newgate
before his confinement he had been a sleek round person addicted obviously to the pleasures of the table
he did not thrive on prison fair
now more strictly meagre thanks to the inspectors and the more stringent discipline and before he embarked for australia to undergo his fourteen years
he was reported to have fallen away to a shadow
having brought down the records of great frauds forgeries and thefts from about eighteen twenty five to eighteen forty
i will now retrace my steps and give some account of the more remarkable murders during that period
no murder has created greater sensation and horror throughout england than that of mister weir by ther teil hunt and provert
as this was accomplished beyond the limits of the metropolis and its perpetrators arreigned at hertford
where the principal actor suffered death the case hardly comes within the limits of my subject
but probert who turned king's evidence and materially assisted conviction
was tried at the old bailey the following year for horse stealing and hanged in front of newgate
the murder was still fresh in the memory of the populace and probert was all but linched on his way to jail
according to his statement when sentenced to death he had been driven to horse stealing by the execration which had pursued him after the murder
every door had been closed against him every hope of future support lasted
since the calamitous event he went on that happened at hertford i have been a lost man
the event which he styles calamitous we may well characterize as one of the most deliberately atrocious murders on record
theirtel was a gambler and weir had won a good deal of money from him
wer was supposed to carry a private bank about with him in a pocket in his under waistcoat
to obtain possession of this fertell with his two associates resolved to kill him
the victim was invited to visit probert's cottage in the country near ell's treet
hortel drove him down in a gig to be killed as he travelled in thertel's own words
the others followed and on overtaking their tail found he had done the job alone in a retired part of the road known as gills hill lane
the murderer explained that he had first fired a pistol at weir's head but the shot glanced off his cheek
then he attacked the other's throat with a penknife and last of all drove the pistol barrel into his forehead
after the murder the villains divided the spoil and went on to probert's cottage and supped off pork chops brought down on purpose
during the night they sought to dispose of the body by throwing it into a pond but two days later had to throw it into another pond
meanwhile the discovery of pistol and knife spattered with human blood and brains
raised the alarm and suspicion fell upon the three murderers who were arrested
the crime was brought home to thatel by the confession of hunt
one of his accomplices who took the police to the pond where the remains of the unfortunate mister weir were discovered sunk in a sack weighted by stones
probert was then admitted as a witness and the case was fully proved against tertel who was hanged in front of hurtford jail
hunt in consideration of the information he had given escaped death and was sentenced to transportation for life
widespread horror and indignation was evoked throughout the kingdom by the discovery of the series
of atrocious murders perpetrated in edinburgh by the miscreants brook and hair
the first of whom has added to the british language a synonym for illegal suppression
the crimes of these inhuman purveyors to medical science do not fall within the limits of this work
but brook and hair had their imitators further south
and of these bishop and williams who were guilty of many peculiar atrocities ended their murderous careers in front of the debtor's door at newgate
bishop whose real name was head married a half sister of williams williams was a professional resurrectionist or body snatcher
a trade almost openly countenanced win subjects for the anatomy schools were only to be got by rifling graves or worse
bishop was a carpenter
but having been suddenly thrown out of work he joined his brother in law in his line of business
after a little
bishop got weary of the dangers and fatigues of exhumation and propose to williams that instead of disinterring they should murder their subjects
bishop confessed that he was moved to this by the example of burke and hair
they pursued their terrible trade for five years without scruple and without detection
eventually the law overtook them but almost by accident
they presented themselves about noon one day at the dissecting room of king's college hospital accompanied by a third man
and a vowed snatcher and habitua of the fortune of war a public house in smithfield frequented openly by men of this awful profession
this man may asked the porter at king's college if he wanted anything a euphemism for offering a body
the porter asked what he had got and the answer was a male subject
reference was made to mister partridge the demonstration in anatomy
and after some haggling they agreed on a price and in the afternoon the snatchers brought a hamper
which contained a body in a sack
the porter received it but from its freshness became suspicious of foul play
mister partridge was sent for and he with some of the students soon decided that the corpse had not died a natural death
the snatchers were detained the police sent for and a rest followed as a matter of course
an inquest was held on the body which was identified as that of an italian boy
carile ferari
who made a living by exhibiting white mice about the streets
and the jury returned a verdict of wilful murder against persons unknown expressing a strong opinion that bishop
williams and may had been concerned in the transaction
meanwhile a search had been made at nova scotia gardens bethnal green where bishop and williams lived
at first nothing peculiar was found but at a second search the back garden ground was dug up
and in one corner at some depth a bundle of clothes were unearthed which with a hairy cap
were known to be what ferari had worn when last seen
in another portion of the garden more clothing partly male and partly female was discovered
plainly pointing to the perpetration of other crimes
these facts were represented before the police magistrate
who examined bishop and his fellows and further incriminating evidence adduced to the effect that the prisoners had bartered for a coach to carry a stiffen
they had also been seen to leave their cottage
carrying out a sack with something heavy inside on this they were fully committed to newgate for trial
this trial came off in due course at the central criminal court where the prisoners were charged on two counts
one that of the murder of the italian boy the other that of a boy unknown
the evidence from first to last was circumstantial
but the jury after a short deliberation did not hesitate to bring in a verdict of guilty and all three were condemned to death
shortly before the day fixed for execution bishop made a full confession the bulk of which bore the impress of truth
although it included statements that were improbable and unsubstantiating
he asserted that the victim was a lincolnshire lad and not an italian boy although the latter was fully proved
according to the confession death had been inflicted by drowning in a well whereas the medical evidence all pointed to violence
it was however pretty clear that this victim like preceding ones
had been lured to nova scotia gardens and there drugged with a large dose of laudanum
while they were in a state of insensibility the murder was committed
bishop's confession was indorsed by williams and the immediate result was the respite of may
a very painful scene occurred in newgate when the news of his escape from death was imparted to may
he fainted and the warrant of mercy nearly proved his death blow
the other two looked on at his agitation with an indifference amounting to apathy
the execution took place a week or two later in the presence of such a crowd as had not been seen near newgate for years
i will close this chapter with a brief account of another murder
the memory of which is still fresh in the minds of londoners although half a century has passed since it was committed
the horror with which green acre's crime struck the town was unparalleled since the time when catherine hayes slew her husband
there were many features of resemblance in these crimes
the decapitation and dismemberment the bestow of the remains in various parts of the town the preservation of the head in spirits of wine
in the hope that the features might some day be recognized were alike in both
the murder in both cases was long a profound mystery in this which i am now describing
a bricklayer found a human trunk near some new buildings in the edgewhere road one morning in the last week of eighteen thirty six
the inquest on these remains which medical examination showed to be those of a female
returned a verdict of wilful murder against some person unknown
on the seventh july eighteen thirty seven
the lockmen of ben johnson locke in stepney fields found a human head jammed into the lock gates
closer investigation proved that it belonged to the trunk already discovered on the second february
a further discovery was made in an osier bed near cold harbour lane camberwell
where a workman found a bundle containing two human legs in a drain
these were the missing members of the same mutilated trunk
and there was now evidence sufficient to establish conclusively that the woman thus collected piecemeal had been barbarously done to death
but the affair still remained a profound mystery no light was thrown upon it till towards the end of march
a mister gay of googe street came to view the head and immediately recognized it as that of a widowed sister hannah brown
who had been missing since the previous christmas day
the murdered individual was thus identified the next step was to ascertain where and with whom she had last been seen
this brought suspicion on to a certain james green acre
whom she was to have married and in whose company she had left her own lodgings to visit his in camberwell
the police wished to refer to green acre but as he was not forthcoming
a warrant was issued for his apprehension which was effected at kennington on the twenty fourth march
a woman named gale who lived with him was arrested at the same time
the prisoners were examined at the merry la bone police court
green acre a stout middle aged man
wrapped in a brown greatcoat assumed an air of insolent bravado
but his despair must have been great as was evident from his attempt to strangle himself in the station house
suspicion grew almost to certainty as the evidence was unfolded
missus brown was a washerwoman supposed to be worth some money hence green acre's offer of marriage
she had realized all her effects and brought them with her furniture two green acres lodgings the two when married were to emigrate to hudson's bay
whether it was greed or a quarrel that drove green acre to the desperate deed remains obscure
they were apparently good friends when last seen together at a neighbor's where they seemed perfectly happy and sociable and eager for the wedding day
but green acre in his confession pretended that he and his intended had quarrelled over her property or the want of it
and that in a moment of anger he knocked her down
he thought he had killed her and in his terror began at once to consider how he might dispose of the body and escape arrest
while she was senseless but really still alive he cut off her head
and dismembered the body in the manner already described
it is scarcely probable that he would have gone to this extremity if he had had no previous evil intention
and the most probable inference is that he inveigled missus brown to his lodgings with the set purpose of taking her life
his measures for the disposal of the corpus delectie remind us of those taken by missus hayes and her associates
or of guardell's frantic efforts to conceal his crime
the most ghastly part of the story is that which deals with his getting rid of the head
this wrapped up in a silk handkerchief
he carried under his coat flaps through the streets and afterwards on his cap in a crowded city omnibus
it was not until he left the bus and walked up by the regent's canal that he conceived the idea of throwing the head into the water
another day elapsed before he got rid of the rest of the body
all of which according to his own confession made no doubt with the idea of exonerating missus gale he accomplished without her assistance
on the other hand it was induced in evidence that missus gale had been at his lodgings the very day after the murder
and was seen to be busily engaged in washing down the house with bucket and mop
green acre when tried at the old bailey admitted that he had been guilty of manslaughter
while conversing with missus brown he declared the unfortunate woman was rocking herself to and fro in a chair
as she leaned back he put his foot against the chair and so tilted it over
missus brown fell with it and green acre to his horror found that she was dead
but the medical evidence was clear that the decapitation had been effected during life and the jury after a short deliberation
without hesitation brought in a verdict of wilful murder
the woman gale was also found guilty but sentence of death was only passed on green acre
the execution was as usual attended by an immense concourse and green acre died amidst the loudest execrations
the chronicles of newgate volume too by arthur griffith section sixteen newgate notorieties continued
cak one
as the century advanced crimes of fraud increased
they not only became more numerous but they were on a wider scale
the most extensive and systematic robberies were planned and carried out so as long to escape detection
one of the earliest of the big operators in fraudulent finance was edward beaumont smith
who was convicted in eighteen forty one of uttering false exchequer bills to an almost fabulous amount
an not entirely novel kind of fraud but when carried out on a larger scale than heretofore
came to light in this same year eighteen forty one
this was the wilful shipwreck and casting away of a vessel which with her supposed cargo had been heavily insured
the dryad was a brig owned principally by two persons named wallace one a seaman the other merchant
she was freighted by the firm of zulouetta and company for a voyage to santa cruz
her owners insured her for a full sum of two thousand pounds after which the wallaces insured her privately
with other underwriters for a second sum of two thousand pounds
after this on the faith of forced bills of lading the captain loose by name
being a party to the intended fraud
they obtained further insurances on goods never shipped
it was fully proved in evidence that when the dryads sailed she carried nothing but the cargo belonging to zulouetta and company
yet the wallace is pretended to have put on board quantities of flannels cloths cotton prints
beef pork butter and earthenwares on all of which they effected insurances
loose had his instructions to cast away the ship on the first possible opportunity and from the time of his leaving liverpool
he acted in a manner which excited the suspicions of the crew
the larboard pump was suffered to remain choked up
and the longboat was fitted with tackles and held ready for use at a moment's notice
the ship however met with exasperatingly fine weather and it was not until the captain reached the west india islands
that he got a chance of accomplishing his crime
at a place called the silver keys he ran the ship on the reef
but another ship concluding that he was acting in ignorance rendered him assistance
the dry lad was got off repaired and her voyage renewed to santa cruiz
he crept along the coast close in shore looking for a quiet spot to cast away the ship
and at last when within fifteen miles of port with wind and weather perfectly fair he ran her on to the rocks
even then she might have been saved but the captain would not suffer the crew to act
nearly the whole of the cargo was lost as well as the ship
the captain and crew however got safely to jamaica and so to england the captain dying on the voyage home
the crime soon became public
mate carpenter and crew were eager to disavow complicity and voluntarily gave information
the wallaces were arrested committed to newgate and tried at the old bailey
the case was clearly proved against them and both were sentenced to transportation for life
while lying in newgate awaiting removal to the convict ship both prisoners made full confessions
according to their own statements the loss of the dryad was only one of six intentional shipwrecks with which they had been concerned
the crime of fraudulent insurance they declared was very common and the under writers must have lost great sums in this way
the merchant wallace said he had been led into the crime by the advice and example of a city friend who had gone largely into this nefarious business
this wallace added that his friend had made several voyages with the distinct intention of superintending the predetermined shipwrecks
the other wallace the sailor also traced his lapse into crime to evil counsel
he was an honest sea captain he said trading from liverpool where once he had the misfortune to be introduced to a man of wealth
the foundations of which had been laid by buying old ships on purpose to cast them away
his person made much of wallace encouraged his attentions to his daughter
and tempted him to take to fraudulent insurance as a certain method of achieving fortune
wallace's relations warned him against his liverpool friend
but he would not take their advice and developing his transactions ended as we had seen
a clergyman nearly a century later followed in the steps of doctor dodd but did not under more humane laws lose his life
the reverend w bailey l l d was convicted at the central criminal court in february eighteen forty three a forgery
a notorious miser robert smith had recently died in seven dials where he had amassed a considerable fortune
but among the charges on the estate he left
was a promissory note for two thousand eight hundred seventy five pounds produced by doctor bailey and purporting to be signed by smith
the executors to the estate disputed the validity of this document
miss bailey the doctor's sister in whose favor the note was said to have been given
then brought an action against the administrators and at the trial doctor bailey swore that the note had been given him by smith
the jury did not believe him and the verdict was for the defendants
subsequently bailey was arrested on a charge of forgery and after a long trial found guilty his sentence was transportation for life
a gigantic conspiracy to defraud was discovered in the following year when a solicitor named william henry barber
joshua fletcher a surgeon and three others were charged with forging wills for the purpose of obtaining unclaimed stock in the funds
there were two separate affairs
in the first a maiden lady miss slack
who was the possessor of two separate sums in consuls neglected through strange carelessness on her own part and that of her friends
to draw the dividends on more than one sum
the other remaining unclaimed for ten years was transferred at the end of that time to the commissioners for the reduction of the national debt
barber it was said became aware of this
and that he gave access to miss slack on pretence of conveying to her some funded property left her by an naut
by this means her signature was obtained a forged will was prepared bequeathing the unclaimed stock to miss slack
a note purporting to be from miss slack was addressed to the governor of the bank of england begging that the said stock might be handed over to her
and a person calling herself miss slack duly attended at the bank where the money was handed over to her improper form
a second will also forged was propounded at doctors commons as that of a missus hunt of bristol
missus hunt had left money in the funds which remained unclaimed and had been transferred as in miss lax case
here again the money with ten years interest was handed over to barber and another calling himself thomas hunt an executor of the will
it was shown that the will must be a forgery
as its signature was dated eighteen twenty nine whereas missus hunt actually died in eighteen o six
a third similar fraud to the amount of two thousand pounds was also brought to light
fletcher was the moving spirit of the whole business it was he who had introduced barber to miss slack
and held all the threads of these intricate and nefarious transactions
barber and fletcher were both transported for life although fletcher declared that barbara was innocent and had no guilty knowledge of what was being done
barbara was subsequently pardoned but was not replaced on the rolls as an attorney till eighteen fifty five
when lord campbell delivered judgment on barbara's petition to the effect that
the evidence to establish his barber's connivance in the frauds was too doubtful for us to continue his exclusion any longer
banks and bankers continued to be victimized
in eighteen forty four
the bank of england was defrauded of a sum of eight thousand pounds by one of its clerks burgess in conjunction with an accomplice named elder
burgess fraudulently transferred consols to the above amount standing in the name of mister oxenford to another party
a person elder of course who personated oxenford attended at the bank to complete the transfer and sell whi stock
burgess who was purposely on leave from the bank affected the sail which was paid for with a check for nearly the whole amount on lubbeck's bank
burgess and elder proceeded in company to cash this but as they wanted all gold
the cashier gave them eight bank of england notes for one thousand pounds each saying that they could get so much specie nowhere else
thither elder went alone provided with a number of canvas and one large carpet bag
but when the latter was filled with gold it was too heavy to lift
and elder had to be assisted by two bank porters who carried it for him to a carriage waiting near the mansion house
the thieves for elder was soon joined by burgess drove together to ben contes the pugilist's public house in saint martin's lane
where the cash was transferred from the carpet bag to a portmanteau
the same evening both started for liverpool and embarking on board the male steamer britannia escaped to the united states
burgess's continued absence was soon noticed at the bank
suspicions were aroused when it was found that he had been employed in selling stock from mister oxenford which developed into certainty
as soon as that gentleman was referred to
mister oxenford having denied that he had made any transfer of stock the matter was at once put into the hands of the police
a smart detective forester after a little inquiry
established the fact that the man who had personated mister oxenford was a horsestealer named joseph elder an intimate acquaintance of burgesses
forester next traced the fugitives to liverpool
and thence to halifax whither he followed them accompanied by a confidential clerk from the bank
at halifax forester learnt that the men he wanted had gone on to boston thence to buffalo and canada and back to boston
he found them at length residing at the latter place one as a landed proprietor the other as a publican
elder the former was soon apprehended at his house but he evaded the law by hanging himself with his pocket handkerchief
the inn belonging to burgess was surrounded
but he escaped through a back door on to the river and rode off in a boat to a hiding place in the woods
next day a person betrayed him for the reward and he was soon captured
the proceeds of the robbery were lodged in a boston bank
but four hundred sovereigns were found on elder while two hundred more were found in burgess's effects
burgess was eventually brought back to england tried at the central criminal court and sentenced to transportation for life
within a month or two the bank of messurs rodgers and company clement's lane was broken into
robberies as daring in conception as they were boldly executed were common enough
one night a quantity of plate was stolen from windsor castle another time buckingham palace was robbed
of this class was the ingenious yet peculiarly simple robbery affected at the house of lord fitzgerald in belgrave square
the butler on the occasion of a death in the family when the house was in some confusion arranged with a burglar to come in
and with another carry off the plate chest in broad daylight and as a matter of business no one interfered or asked any questions
the thief walked into the house in belgrave square and openly carried off the plate chest deposited it in a light cart at the door and drove away
how is the steward
accused the other sermons but they retorted
declaring that he had been visited by the thief the day previous
whom he had shown over the plate closet
hows and his accomplice were arrested
the former was found guilty and sentenced
to fifteen years
but the latter was acquitted
stealing plate
was about this period the crime of a more aristocratic thief
the club spoons and other articles of plate
were long a source of profitable income
to a gentleman named ashley
who belonged to five good london clubs
the junior united service
the union
reform
colonial
and erectium clubs
when one of these clubs was taken in at the army and navy
that establishment also suffered
suspicion fell at length upon ashley
who was seen to handle the forks and spoons at table
in a strange manner
a watch was set on his house in allington street pimlico
and one day
a police constable tracked him to a silversmith's in holborn hill
where ashly produced four silver spoons and begged that his initials might be engraved upon them
ashley was arrested as he left the shop

the spoons were impounded
and it was found that the club monogram had been erased from them
on a search of the prisoner's lodgings in allington street
a silver fork was found
a number of pawnbrokers duplicates and three small files
it was proved at the trial that ashley had asked his landlady for brick dust and leather
and it was contented
that these with the files were used to alter the marks on the plate
at most of the clubs
the servants had been multed to make good lost plate
which had no doubt been stolen by the prisoner
several pawnbrokers were suppoened
and obliged to surrender plate
to the extent in some cases of a couple of dozen
of spoons or forks
which the various club secretaries identified as the property of their respective clubs
ashley was the son of an army agent and banker
and many witnesses were brought to attest to his previous good character
but he was found guilty and sentenced to seven years transportation
a robbery of a somewhat novel kind
was executed in rather a bungling fashion by cur
a sea captain
whose ship brought home a mixed cargo from bahia
and other ports
part of the freight
were four hundred rough diamonds valued at four thousand pounds
these packages were consigned to messrs schroder of london
and as it was known that they were to arrive in kare's ship
one of the owners had met her at deal
but the captain had already absconded with the packages of precious stones in his pocket
care came at once to london and by the help of the landlord of a public house in smithfield and others
disposed of the whole of the diamonds
a jew named benjamin affected the sale to certain merchants named blogue and martin
who declared that the rough diamond market
was in such a depressed condition
that they could only afford to give one thousand seven fifty pounds for stones worth
four thousand pounds
the circumstances of this purchase of brilliance from a stranger at such an inadequate price
was strongly commented upon
at kara's trial
the moment it was discovered that the diamonds had disappeared
the affair was taken up by the police
farester the detective who had pursued and captured burgess at boston
tracked care to france
and following him there eventually captured him
at montlais
he was arraigned at the old bailey
and the case fully proved

his sentence
was seven years transportation
the gravest crimes continued at intervals to inspire the town with horror
and concentrate public attention upon the jail of newgate
and the murderers immured within its walls
crevassier's case made a great stir
there was unusual atrocity in this murder of an aged
infirm gentlemen
a scion of the ducal house of bedford
by his confidential valet and personal attendant
lord william russell lived alone in norfolk street
park lane
he was a widower
and seventy three years of age
one morning in may
his lordship was found dead in his bed with his throat cut
the fact of the murder was first discovered by the housemaid
who on going down early
was surprised to find the dining room
in a state of utter confusion
the furniture turned upside down the drawers of the escritoire open and rifled
a bundle lying on the floor as though thebes had been interrupted in the act
the housemaid summoned the cook
and both went to call the valet
crovassier
who came from his room ready dressed a suspicious circumstance as he was always late in the morning

the housemaid suggested
that they should see if his lordship was all right
and the three went to his bedroom

while couvoisier opened the shutters
the housemaid approaching the bed
saw that the pillow was saturated with blood
the discovery of the murdered man immediately followed
the neighborhood was alarmed
the police sent four
and a close inquiry forthwith commenced
that lord william russell had committed suicide was at once declared impossible
it was also clearly proved
that no forcible entry had been made into the house
the fresh marks of violence upon the door had evidently been made inside
and not from outside
more answer
the instruments poker and chisel by which they had no doubt been effected
were found in the butler's pantry
used by crurvacie
the researches of the police soon laid bare other suspicious facts
the bundle found in the dining room contained with cloves
various small articles of plate and jewelry
which a thief would probably have put into his pocket
upstairs in the bedroom everous leou box for sovereigns had been broken open
also the jewel box and note case from the latter of which was abstracted a ten pound note
known to have been in the possession of the deceased
his lordship's watch was gone
further suspicion was caused by the position of a book
and a wax candle
by the bedside
the latter was so placed that it could throw no light on the former
which was a life of sir samuel romilly
the intention of the real murderer to shift the crime to burglars
was evident
although futile
and the police feeling convinced that the crime had been committed by some inmate of the house
took crovassier into custody and placed the two female servants under surveillance
the valet's strange demeanor had attracted attention from the first
he had hung over the body in a state of dreadful agitation
answering no questions
and taking no part
in the proceedings
three days later
a close search of the butler's pantry produced fresh circumstantial evidence
behind the skirting board
several of his lordship's rings were discovered
near it was his waterloo metal
and the above mentioned ten pound note
further investigation was rewarded by the discovery in the pantry
of a split gold ring
used by lord william to carry his keys on
next and in the same place
a chaste gold key
and at last his lordship's watch was found secreted under the leds of the sick

all this was evidence sufficient to warrant crovassier's committal for trial
but still he found friends
and a liberal subscription was raised among the foreign servants in london
to provide funds for his defence
crivassier when put on his trial
pleaded not guilty
but on the second day the discovery of fresh evidence
more particularly the recovery of some of lord william's stolen plate
induced the prisoner to make a full confession of his crime
to the lawyers who defended him

this placed them in a position of much embarrassment

to have thrown up their brief would have been to have secured corvassier's conviction
mister phillips who led in the case went to the other extreme
and in an impassioned address
implored the jury not to send an innocent man to the gallows
it will be remembered that the question whether mister phillips had not exceeded the limits usually allowed to counsel was much debated at the time
the jury without hesitation found croevassier guilty
and he was sentenced to death
the prisoner's demeanour had greatly changed during the trial
coolness amounting almost to effrontery gave way to hopeless dejection
on his removal to newgate after sentence
he admitted that he had been justly convicted
and expressed great anxiety that his fellow servants should be relieved from all suspicion
later in the day he tried to commit suicide by cramming a towel down his throat
but was prevented
next morning he made a full confession
in presence of his attorney
and the governor mister cope
in this
he gave as the motives of his crime a quarrel he had with his master
who threatened to discharge him
without a character

lord william according to the ballet
was of a peevish difficult temper
he was annoyed with his man for various small omissions and acts of forgetfulness

and on the night of the murder
had taken crevassier ta task rather sharply
finally on coming downstairs after bedtime
lord william had found crevassier in the dining room
what are you doing here asked his lordship
you can have no good intentions you must quit my service to morrow morning
this seems to have decided crovascier
who took a carving knife from the sideboard in the dining room
went upstairs to lord william's bedroom
and drew the knife across his throat
he appeared to die instantly said the murderer in conclusion
his account of his acts and movements after the deed
varied so considerably in the several documents he left behind that too much reliance cannot be placed upon his confession
his last statement contains the words
the public now think i am a liar
and they will not believe me when i say the truth
this was no doubt the case
but
this much truth his confession may be taken to contain
that crevassier was idle
discontented
ready to take offence
greedy of gain
that he could not resist the opportunity for robbery offered him by his situation
at lord william russells
pih
that when vexed with his master
he did not shrink from murder
both for revenge
and to conceal his other crimes
crevassier wished to commit suicide in newgate
but was prevented by the vigilant supervision
to which he was subjected while in jail
the attempt was to have been made by opening a vein and allowing himself to bleed to death
the sunday night before his execution
he would not go to bed when ordered
the governor insisted
but crevassier showed great reluctance to strip
the order was however at length obeyed
and the whole of the prisoner's clothes
were minutely searched
in the pocket of the coat
mister cope the governor found a neatly folded cloth
and asked what it was for
crevassier admitted that he had intended to bind it tightly round his arm
and bleed himself to death in the night
the next inquiry was how he hoped to open a vein
i
with a bit of sharpened stick
picked out of the ordinary firewood
where is it asked the governor
the prisoner replied that he had left it in the mattress of which he had just been deprived
the bed was searched but no piece of sharpened wood was found
it was thought
that it might have been lost in changing the mattresses
the cloth above referred to belonged to the inner seem of his trousers which he had managed
to tear out
there is nothing to show that crevassier
really contemplated self destruction
a murder which reproduced many of the features of that committed by green acre soon followed
and excited the public mind even more than that of corvassiers
daniel good's crime might have remained long undiscovered
but for his own careless stupidity
he was coachman to a gentleman at roehampton
o
one day he went into a pawnbroker's at wandsworth
and bought a pair of breeches on credit
at the same time he was seen to steal and secrete a pair of trousers
the shop boy gave information
good was followed to his stables by a policeman
but obstinately denied the theft
the policeman insisted on searching the premises
at which good displayed some uneasiness
this increased when the officer accompanied by two others a neighbor and a bailiff
entered one of the stables
good now offered to go to wandsworth
and satisfied the pawnbroker
just at this moment however
the searchers found concealed under two trusses of hay
a woman's headless and dismembered trunk
at the constable's cry and alarm
good rushed from the stable
and locked the door behind him
some time elapsed before the imprisoned party could force open the doors and by then the fugitive had escaped
medical assistance having been summoned
it was ascertained how the dismemberment had been effected
at the same time
an overpowering odor attracted them to the adjoining harness room
where the missing remains were raked out
half consumed in the ashes of a wood fire
in the same room a large axe and saw were found
covered with blood
inquiry into the character of good exposed him as a loose liver
who kept company with several women
one called his sister but supposed to be his wife

had occupied a room in south street
manchester square
with a son of goods by a former wife
another wife real or fictitious
existed in spittl fields
and evidence was given of close relation between good and a third woman a girl named butcher
residing at woolwich
the victim was the first of these three
good had told her much to her perturbation
that she was to move from south street to roehampton
and one day he fetched her
they were seen together on barnes common
and again in putney park lane
where they were talking loud and angrily
the poor creature was never seen again alive
the actual method of the murder
was never exactly ascertained
good himself remained at large for some weeks
he had tramped as far as tunbridge
phew
where he obtained work as a bricklayer's laborer
he there gave satisfaction for industry
but he was taciturn
and would hold no converse with his fellows
the woman where he lodged noticed that he was very restless at night
moaning and sighing much

detection came unexpectedly
he was recognized by an ex policeman
who had known him at roehampton
and immediately arrested
in his effects were found the clothes he had on at the time of his escape from the stables
and under the jacket he was wearing
was a piece of a woman's calico apron
stained with blood
which he had used to save the pressure on his shoulder by the hot
good was committed to newgate
and tried at the central criminal court
before a crowded court
he made a rambling defence
ended by saying
good ladies and gentlemen all i have a great deal more to say
but i am so bad i cannot say it
the chronicles of newgate volume two by arthur griffith's section seventeen newgate notorieties continued part two
hawker's murder is in its way interesting as affording another proof of the extraordinary way in which the culprit returned to the scene of his guilt
the cries of his victim a mister delarue
brought passers by and policeman to the spot a lonely place near a dead wall beyond belsize hall hampstead
but too late to give substantial aid
while the body lay there still warm battered and bleeding from the cruel blows inflicted upon him by his cowardly assailant a man came by singing
he entered into conversation with the policeman and learnt as it seemed for the first time what had happened
his remark was it is a nasty job he took hold of the dead hand and confessed that he felt queer at the shocking sight
this sight was his own handiwork
yet he could not overcome the strange fascination it had for him and remained by the side of the corpse till the stretcher came
even then he followed it as far as bel size lane
it was here that the others engaged in their dismal office in removing the dead first got a good look at the stranger's face
he wanted a light for a cigar and got it from a lantern which was lifted up and fully betrayed his features
it was noticed that he wore a mackintosh next day the police in making a careful search of the scene of the murder
picked up a coat button which afterwards played an important part in the identification of the murderer
a letter which afforded an additional clue was also found in the pocket of the deceased
still it was many weeks before any arrest was made
in the meantime the police were not idle
it came out by degrees that the person who had been seen in belsize lane on the night the body was found was a friend of the deceased
his name was hacker he was by trade a lady's shoemaker and it was also ascertained that after the day of the murder he was flush of money
he was soon afterwards arrested on suspicion and a search of his lodgings brought to light several garments saturated with blood
a coat among them much torn and stained with three buttons missing one of which corresponded with that picked up at hampstead
the letter found in the pocket of the deceased was sealed with a wafer marked f
and many of the same sort were found in the possession of the accused this was enough to obtain a committal
after several remans but the case contained elements of doubt and the evidence of the trial was entirely circumstantial
a witness deposed to meeting hawker soon after the cries of murder were heard
running at a dog trot into london and others swore that they plainly recognized him as the man seen soon afterwards in a lane
a woman whom he called on the same evening declared he had worn a mackintosh his coat was much torn there was a stain of blood on his shirt cuff
and he was in possession the first time to her knowledge of a watch
this was delarou's watch fully identified as such which harcker told his brother delaroux had given him the mourning of the murder
these were damnatory facts which well supported the prosecution
the prisoner made an elaborate defence in which he sought to vilify the character of deceased
as the seducer of an innocent girl to whom he hacker had been fondly attached
when her ruin was discovered her brother panted for revenge
hawker whose skill in counterfeiting handwriting was known was asked to fabricate a letter making an assignation with jellarou
in a lonely part of hampstead
harker and the brother went to the spot where the latter left him to meet his sister's seducer alone
soon afterwards hawker heard cries of murder
and proceeding to where they came from found delaroe dead slain by the furious brother
hacker was so overcome feeling himself the principal cause of the tragedy
that he rushed to a slaughter house in hampstead and purposely stained his clothes with blood
such an extravagant defence did not weigh with judge or jury
the first summed up dead against the prisoner and the latter after retiring for ten minutes found him guilty
hawker's conduct in newgate while under sentence of death was most extraordinary
he drew up several long statements containing narratives purely fictitious imputing crimes to his victim and repeating his line of defence
that delaroo had suffered by the hands of imaginary outraged brothers acting as the avengers of females deeply injured by him
harker made several pretended confessions and revelations all of which were proved to be absolutely false by the police on inquiry
his demeanor was a strange compound of wickedness falsehood and deceit
but at the fatal hour his hardihood forsook him and he was almost insensible when taken out of his cell for execution
restoratives were applied but he was in a fainting condition when tied and had to be supported by the assistant executioner
while colcraft adjusted the noose
there was an epidemic of murder in the united kingdom about eighteen forty eight to nine
in november of the first named year occurred the wholesale slaughterer of the jermeys in their house stanfield hall by the miscreant rush
soon afterwards in gloucestershire
a maidservant sarah thomas murdered her mistress an aged woman by beating out her brains with a stone
next year john gleese and wilson at liverpool murdered a woman anne henrison also a maidservant and two children
while in ireland a wife dashed out her husband's brains with a hammer
london did not escape the contagion and prominent among the detestable crimes of the period stands that of the mannings at bermondsey
these great criminals suffered at horsemonger laying jail but they were tried at the central criminal court and were for some time inmates of newgate
their victim was a man named patrick o conner a custom house gauger who had been a suitor of marie deru before she became missus manning
marie deru up to the time of her marriage had been in service as ladies maid to lady blantire daughter of the duchess of sutherland
and manning hoped to get some small government appointment through his wife's interest
he had failed in this as well as in the business of a publican which he had at one time adopted
after the marriage a close intimacy was still maintained between okoner and the mannings
he lived at mile end whence he walked often to call at three minver place bermondsey the residence of his old love
oconner was a man of substance he had long followed the profitable trade of a money lender
and by dint of u serious interest on small sums advanced to needy neighbors had amassed as much as eight thousand pounds or ten thousand pounds
his wealth was well known to maria as he called missus manning who made several ineffectual attempts to get money out of him
at last this fiendish woman made up her mind to murder o conor and appropriate all his possessions
her husband to whom she coolly confided her intention
a heavy brutish fellow was yet aghast at his wife's resolve and tried hard to dissuade her from bad purpose
in his confession after sentence he declared that she plied him well with brandy at this period
and that during the whole time he was never in his right senses
meanwhile this woman unflinching in her cold bloody determination carefully laid all her plans for the consummation of the deed
one fine afternoon in august o conner was met walking in the direction of bermondsey
he was dressed with particular care as he was to dine at the mannings and meet friends one a young lady
he was seen afterward smoking and talking with his hosts in their back parlor and never seen again alive
it came out in the husband's confession that missus manning induced o connor to go down to the kitchen to wash his hands that she followed him to the basement
that she stood behind him as he stood near the open grave she herself had dug for him
and which he mistook for a drain and that while he was speaking to her she put the muzzle of a pistol close to the back of his head and shot him down
she ran upstairs told her husband made him go down to look at her handiwork and as o'kanar was not quite dead
manning gave the coup de gras with a crowbar
after this missus manning changed her dress and went off in a cab to okaner's lodgings
which having possessed herself of the murdered man's keys she rifled from end to end
returning to her own home where manning meantime had been calmly smoking and talking to the neighbors over the basement wall
the corpse lying just inside the kitchen all the while the two set to work to strip the body and hide it under the stones of the floor
this job was not completed till the following day as the whole had to be enlarged and the only tool they had was a dust shrouvle
a quantity of quicklime was thrown in with the body to destroy all identification
this was on a thursday evening
for the remainder of that week and part of the next the murderer stayed in the house and occupied the kitchen close to the remains of their victim
on the sunday missus manning roasted a goose at this same kitchen fire and ate it with relish in the afternoon
this cold blooded indifference after the event was only outdone by the premeditation of this horrible murder
the whole must have been excavated and the quicklime purchased quite three weeks before okanar met his death
and during that time he must frequently have stood or sat over his own grave
discovery of the murder came in this wise okaner a punctual and well conducted official was at once missed at the london docks
on the third day his friends began to inquire for him
and at their request two police officers were sent to burmonsey to inquire for him at the mannings with whom it was well known that he was very intimate
the mannings had seen or heard nothing of him of course as o'koner still did not turn up the police after a couple of days returned to minver place
the house was empty bare and stripped of all its furniture and its former occupants had decamped
the circumstance was suspicious and a search was at once made of the whole premises
in the back kitchen one of the detectives remarked that the cement between certain stones looked lighter than the rest and on trying it with a knife
he found that it was soft and new while elsewhere it was set and hard
the stones were at once taken up
beneath them was a layer of fresh mortar beneath that a lot of loose earth amongst which a stocking was turned up and presently a human toe
six inches lower the body of okanar was uncovered
he was lying on his face his legs tied up to his hips so as to allow of the body fitting into the hole
the lime had done its work so rapidly that the features would have been indistinguishable but for the prominent chin and a set of false teeth
the corpse settled all doubts and the next point was to lay hands upon the mannings
it was soon ascertained that the wife had gone off in a cab with a quantity of luggage
part of this she had deposited to be left till called for at one station while she had gone herself to another that at euston square
at the first the boxes were impounded opened and found to contain many of okanar's effects
at the second exact information was obtained of missus manning's movements she had gone to edinburgh
a telegraphic message then newly adapted to the purposes of criminal detection
advised the edinburgh police of the whole affair and within an hour an answer was telegraphed stating that missus manning was in custody
she had been to brokers to negotiate the sale of certain foreign railway stock with which they had been warned from london not to deal
and they had given information to the police
her arrest was planned and when the telegram arrived from london completed
an examination of her boxes disclosed a quantity of okonar's property
missus manning was transferred to london and lodged in the horsemonger lane jail where her husband soon afterwards joined her
he had fled to jersey where he was recognized and arrested
each tried to throw the blame on the other manning declared his wife had committed the murder missus manning indignantly denied the charge
the prisoners were in due course transferred to newgate to be put upon their trial at the central criminal court
a great number of distinguished people assembled as usual at the old bailey on the day of trial
the mannings were arraigned together the husband standing at one of the front corners of the dock his wife at the other end
manning who was dressed in black appeared to be a heavy bull necked repulsive looking man with a very fair complexion and light hair
missus manning was not without personal charms
her face was comely she had dark hair and good eyes and was above the middle height yet inclined to be stout
she was smartly dressed in a plaid shawl a white lace cap
her hair was dressed in long crape bands she had lace ruffles at her wrist and wore primrose colored kid gloves
the case rested upon the facts which have been already set forth and was proved to the satisfaction of the jury who brought in a verdict of guilty
manning when sentence of death was passed on him said nothing
but missus manning speaking in a foreign accent addressed the court with great fluency and vehemence
she complained that she had no justice there was no law for her she had found no protection either from judges the prosecutor or her husband
she had not been treated like a christian but like a wild beast of the forest she declared that the money found in her possession had been sent her from abroad
that oconner had been more to her than her husband that she ought to have married him
it was against common sense to charge her with murdering the only friend she had in the world
the culprit was really her husband who killed oconer out of jealousy and revengeful feelings
when the judge assumed the black cat
missus manning became still more violent shouting no no i will not stand it you ought to be ashamed of yourselves
and would have left the dock had not mister cope the governor of newgate restrained her
after judgment was passed she repeatedly cried out shame
and stretching out her hand she gathered up a quantity of the roo which following ancient custom dating from the days of the jail fever
was strewn in front of the dock and sprinkled it towards the bench with a contemptuous gesture
on being removed to newgate from the court missus manning became perfectly furious
she uttered loud imprecations cursing judge jury barristers witnesses and all who stood around
they had to handcuff her by force against the most violent resistance and still she raged and stormed
shaking her clenched and manacled hands in the officers faces
from newgate the mannings were taken in separate cabs to horsemonger lane jail
on this journey her manner changed completely she became flippant joked with the officers asked how they liked her resolution in the dock
and expressed the utmost contempt for her husband whom she never intended to acknowledge or speak to again
later her mood changed to abject despair
on reaching the condemned cell she threw herself upon the floor and shrieked in an hysterical agony of tears
after this until the day of execution she recovered her spirits and displayed reckless effrontery
mocking at the chaplain and turning a deaf ear to the counsels of a benevolent lady who came to visit
now she abused the jury now calling manning a vagabond
and through all ate heartily at every meal slept soundly at night and talked with cheerfulness on almost any subject
nevertheless she attempted to commit suicide by driving her nails purposely left long into her throat
she was discovered just as she was getting black in the face
manning's demeanour was more in harmony with his situation and the full confession he made
elucidated all dark and uncertain points in connection with the crime
the actual execution which took place at another prison than newgate is rather beyond the scope of this work
but it may be mentioned that the concourse was so enormous that it drew down the well merited andtrenchant disapproval of charles dickens
who wrote to the times saying that he believed a sight so inconceivably awful
as the wickedness and levity of the immense crowd collected at the execution this morning could be imagined by no man
and presented by no heathen land under the sun
the horrors of the gibbet and of the crime which brought the wretched murderers to it
faded in my mind before the atrocious bearing looks and language of the assembled spectators
when i came upon the scene at midnight the shrillness of the cries and howls that were raised from time to time
denoting that they came from a concourse of boys and girls already assembled in the best places made my blood run cold
it will be in the memory of many that missus manning appeared on the scaffold in a black satin dress which was bound tightly round her waist
this preference brought the costly stuff into disrepute and its unpopularity lasted for nearly thirty years
i will briefly describe one or two of the more remarkable murders in the years immediately following then pass on to another branch of crime
robert marley at the time of his arrest called himself a surgical instrument maker
it was understood also that he had served in the army as a private and had moreover undergone a sentence of transportation
but it was supposed that he had been once in a good position wellborn and well educated
when lying under sentence of death in newgate he was visited by a lady a gentlewoman in every sense of the word who was said to be his sister
his determined addiction to evil courses had led to his being cast off by his family
and he must have been at the end of his resources when he committed the crime for which he suffered
his offence was the murder of richard cope
a working jeweler shopman to a mister berry of parliament street it was cope's duty to stay in the shop till the last closed the shutters
secure the stock of watches and jewelery then lock up the place and take on the keys to mister barry's private house in pimlico
cope a small man crippled and of weakly constitution was alone in the shop about nine thirty
the shutters were up and he was preparing to close when marly entered and fell upon him with a life preserver
meaning to kill him and rifle the shop
the noise of the struggle was heard outside in the street
and bystanders peeped in through the shutters but no one entered or sought to interfere in what seemed only a domestic quarrel
a milliner's porter
larrigo was also attracted by the noise of the row but after walking a few paces he felt dissatisfied and returned to the spot
pushing the shop door open he saw marly finishing his murderous assault
larigo turned for assistance to take the man into custody
marly disturbed picked up a cigar and parcel from the counter then ran out pursued by lyrigo only
marly ran along the street down into cannon row
then into palace yard where the watermen of the cab tank in obedience to larigo's shouts collared the fugitive
escorted by his two captors marly was taken back into parliament street to the jeweller's shop
the policemen were now in possession
two of them supported cope who was still alive although insensible and marly was apprehended the evidence against him was completed
by his identification by cope in westminster hospital who survived long enough to make a formal deposition before mister jardin
the police magistrate that marly was the man who had beaten him to death
marly at his trial was undefended and the sheriffs offered him counsel but he declined the witnesses against him all spoke the truth he said
there was no case to make out why waste money on lawyers for their defence his demeanour was cool and collected throughout
he seemed while in newgate
to realize thoroughly that there was no hope for him and was determined to face his fate bravely
after sentence the newgate officers who had special charge of him noticed that he slept well and ate well enjoying all his meals
one of them went into his cell just at dinner time
the great clock of saint sepulchrs close by was striking the hour and marly who had his elbows on the table
with his head resting on his hands looked up and observed calmly go along clark come along gallows
on the dread morning he came out to execution quite gaily and tripped up the stairs to the scaffold
his captors it may be added
larigo and allen were warmly commended by the judge for their courage and activity
the former was given a reward of twenty and the latter of ten pounds
a murderous assault on a police constable which so nearly ended fatally that the culprit was sentenced to death although not executed
was perpetrated in eighteen fifty two the case was accompanied with the most shocking brutality
cannon by trade a chimney sweep had long been characterized by the bitterest hatred of the police force
and had been repeatedly sentenced to imprisonment for most desperate and ferocious attacks upon various constables his last victim was dwyre
a fine young officer who had been summoned to take cannon into custody when the latter was drunk and riotous in front of a public house
dwier found cannon bleeding profusely from a wound in the head and persuaded him to go to a doctor's
they walked together quietly for some little distance then cannon without the slightest warning
threw the constable on his back and violently assaulted him by jumping on his chest and stomach
and by getting his hand inside dowier's stock with the idea of strangling him
do i er managed to overpower his assailant and got to his feet but cannon butt it at him with his head and again threw him to the ground
after which he kicked his prostrate foe in the most brutal and cowardly manner and until he was almost senseless and bruised from head to foot
once more do yar got to his feet and managed by drawing his staff to keep cannon at bay until a second constable came to his aid
all this time not one of a numerous body of bystanders offered to assist the policeman in his extremity
on the contrary many of them encouraged the brutal assailant in his savage attack
to canon's infinite surprise he was indicted for attempt to murder and not for a simple assault
and found guilty
the judge in passing sentence of death
told him he richly deserved the punishment
as dwier survived canon escape the death sentence which was commuted to penal servitude for life
a handsome sum was subscribed for the injured constable who was disabled for life
only a few have vied with cannon and fiendish cruelty and brutality
one of these was mobs who lived in the minories
generally known by the sobriquet of general haynow a name execrated in england about this time
mobs systematically ill used his wife for a long space of time and at last cut her throat
for this he was executed in front of newgate in eighteen thirty three
emmanuel barsili me again
the french refugee was a murderer of the same description who despatched his victim with a loaded cane after which to secure his escape
he shot an old soldier who had attempted to detain him he was convicted and executed
he died impenitent declaring that he had no belief and that it was idle to ask forgiveness of god
i want forgiveness of man i want those doors of the prison opened
bartha lamy was generally supposed to have been a secret agent of the french police
i will now pass to grave but less atrocious crimes
in eighteen fifty occurred the first of a series of gigantic frauds
which followed each other at no long intervals which had a strong family likeness and originated all of them to make money easily
without capital and at railroad speed
walter watts was an inventor a creator who struck an entirely new and original line of crime
employed as a clerk in the globe of assurance
he with unusual quickness of apprehension discovered and promptly turned to account and inexcusably laxed system of management
which offered peculiar chances of profit to an ingenious and unscrupulous man
it was the custom in this office to make the banker's passbook the basis of the entries in the company's ledgers
thus when a payment was made by the company the amount dispersed was carried to account in the general books from its entry in the passbook
and without reference to or comparison with the documents in which the payment was claimed
this pass book when not at the bank was in the exclusive custody of wats
the checks drawn by the directors also passed through his hands to him too they came back to be verified and put by
after they had been cashed by the bank
in this way watts had complete control over the whole of the monetary transactions of the company
he could do what he liked with the passbook and by its adoption as described as the basis of all entries
there was no independent check upon him if he chose to tamper with it
this he did to an enormous extent
continually altering erasing and adding figures to correspond with and cover the abstractions he made of various checks as they were drawn
it seems incredible that this pass book which when produced in court
was a mass of blots and erasures should not have created suspicion of foul play either at the bank or at the company's board
implicit confidence appears to have been placed in watts who was the son of an old entrusted employe and moreover a young man of plausible address
watts led two lives
in the west end he was a man of fashion with a town house a house at brighton and a cellar full of good wine at both
he wrote a priceless hack in rotten row
or drove down to richmond in a male phaeton in pair
he played high and spent his nights at the club or in joyous and dissolute company
when other pleasures pulled he took a theatre and posed as a munificent patron of the dramatic art
under his auspices several stars appeared on the boards of the merry labone theatre
and later he became manager of the newly rebuilt olympic at which street
no one cared too closely to inquire into the sources of wealth some said he was a fortunate speculator in stocks
others that he had had extraordinary luck as a gold digger had his west end and little informed associates followed him into the city
whither he was taken every morning in a smart broam they would have seen him alight from it in cornhill
and walk forward on foot to enter as a humble and unpretending employee the doors of the globe assurance office
nevertheless in this position through the culpable carelessness which left him unfettered he managed between eighteen forty four
and eighteen fifty to embezzle and apply to his own purposes some seventy one thousand pounds
the detection of these frauds came while he was still prominently before the world as the lessie of the olympic
rumors were abroad that serious defalcations had been discovered in one of the insurance offices
but it was long before the public realized that the fraudulent clerk and the great theatrical manager were one and the same person
wante his crime was discovered by the secretary of the globe company who came suddenly upon the extensive falsification of the passbook
an inquiry was at once set on foot and the frouds were traced to watts
the latter when first taxed with his offence protested his innocence boldly and positively denied all knowledge of the affair
and he had so cleverly destroyed all traces that it was not easy to bring home the charge
but it was proved that watts had appropriated one check for fourteen hundred pounds
which he had paid into his own bankers and on this he was committed to newgate for trial
there were two counts in the indictment
one for stealing a check value fourteen hundred pounds the second for stealing a bit of paper value one penny
the jury found him guilty of the latter only with a point of law reserved this was fully argued before three judges
and not for the slight offence as it appeared on the record
the sentence of the court one of ten years transportation struck the prisoner with dismay
he had been led to suppose that twelvemonths imprisonment was the utmost the law could inflict and he broke down utterly under the unexpected blow
that same evening he committed suicide in newgate
the details of the suicide were given at the inquest
watts had been in ill health from the time of his first arrest
in gildsbur street cumpter where he was first lodged
he showed symptoms of delirium tremens and admitted that he had been addicted to the excessive use of stimulants
his health had proved but he was still indifferent when he was brought up for sentence and he was an occupant of the newgate infirmary
he returned from court in a state of gloomy dejection
and in the middle of the night one of the fellow prisoners who slept in the same ward noticed that he was not in his bed
this man got up to look for him and found him hanging from the bars of a neighboring room
he had made use of a piece of rope
cut out from the sacking of his bedstead
and had tied his feet together with a silk pocket handkerchief
the prison officers were called but wats was quite gold and stiff when he was cut down
strange to say a second suicide occurred in newgate the same night
that of a prize fighter named donovan tried the same day and convicted of manslaughter
sentence of death had been recorded against jonovan who like watts had seemingly been overcome with sudden despair
in eighteen fifty three a second case of gigantic fraud alarmed and scandalized the financial world
it outshone the defalcations of wats
nothing to equal the excitement caused by the forgeries of robert ferdinand preese had been known before in the city of london
he was a corn merchant who operated largely in green
so enormous were his transactions that they often affected the markets and caused great fluctuations and prices
these had been attributed to political action some thought that the large purchases in foreign grains effected at losing prices
were intended by the protectionists to depress the wheat market and secure the support of the farmers at the forthcoming election
others that napoleon the third but recently proclaimed emperor of the french wished to gain the popularity necessary to secure the people
few realized that these mysterious operations were the convulsive attempt of a ruined and dishonest speculator to sustain his credit
preeze although enjoying a high reputation in the city had long been in a bad way
his extensive business had been carried on by fraud
his method was to obtain advances twice over on the same bills of lading or corn warts the duplicates were forged
in this way he obtained vast sums from several firms and one to which he was indebted upwards of fifty thousand pounds subsequently stopped payment
preeze at length was discovered
threw a dishonoured check for three thousand pounds paid over as an instalment of eighteen thousand pounds owing for an advance on warrants
inquiries were instituted when the check was protested which led to the discovery of the forgeries
praise was lodged in newgate tried at the old bailey and transported for life
another set of frauds which resembled those of preese in principle although not in practice were soon afterwards discovered
proposed to gain the capital he needed for business purposes by raising money on dock warrants for imported goods which had no real existence
when such goods arrived or they were frequently left at a wharf paying rent until it suited the importer to remove them
but dark warrant was issued by the wharfanger as certificate that he held the goods
the warrant thus represented money and was often used as such being indorsed and passed from hand to hand as other negotiable bills
coal's plan was to have a wharf of his own
nominally occupied by a creature trading as maltbi an company
goods would be landed at this wharf
malt being company would issue warrants on them deliverable to the importer and the goods were then passed to be stored in neighboring warehouses
the owners of the latter would then issue a second set of warrants on these goods in total ignorance of the fact that they were already pledged
coale quickly raised money on both sets of warrants he carried on this game for some time with great success
and so developed his business that in one year his transactions amounted to a couple of millions of pounds
he had several narrow escapes
once a warrant holder sent down a clerk to view certain goods and the clerk found that these goods had already a stop upon them or were pledged
col escaped by throwing the blame on a careless partner and at once removed the stop
again some of the duplicate and fictitious warrants were held by a firm which suspended payment and there was no knowing into whose hands they might fall
col found out where they were and redeemed them at a heavy outlay thus obtaining business relations with the firm that held them
which were soon developed much to that firm's subsequent anger and regret
last of all the well known bankers over end and gernie whose own affairs created much excitement some years later
wishing to verify the value of warrants they held and sending to maltpian company's wharf found out half the truth
these bankers wishing for more specific information
ask davidson and gordon a firm with which coal was closely alive whether the warrants meant goods or nothing
they could not deny that the latter was the truth and were forthwith stigmatized by mister chapman overend in gearney's representative as rogues
chronicles of newgate volume two by arthur griffith's section eighteen
newgate notorieties continued part through
the course of the swindlers was by no means smooth but it was not till eighteen fifty four that suspicion arose that anything was wrong
a firm which held a lot of warrants suddenly demanded the delivery of the goods they covered
the goods having no existence coal of course could not deliver them
about this time davidson and gordon the people above mentioned
who had fraudulent warrants out of their own to the extent of one hundred fifty thousand pounds suspended payment and absconded
this affected coal's credit and ugly reports were in circulation charging him with the issue of simulated warrants
these indeed were out to the value of three hundred sixty seven thousand eight hundred pounds
coald's difficulties increased more and more
warrant holders came down upon him demanding to realize their goods
coal now suspended payment
maltbi who had bolted was pursued and arrested to end his life miserably by committing suicide in a newgate cell
cold too was apprehended and in due course tried at the central criminal court
he was found guilty and sentenced to the seemingly inadequate punishment of four years transportation
davidson and gordon were also sentenced to imprisonment
a more distressing case stands next on the criminal records
the failure and subsequent sentence of the bankers measres strayhand pole and bates
for the fraudulent disposal of securities lodged in their hands this firm was one of the oldest banking establishments in the kingdom
and dated back to the commonwealth when under the title of snow and walton it carried on business as pawnbrokers
the stray hand of the firm which came to grief was a snow who changed his name for a fortune of two hundred thousand pounds
he was a man esteemed and respected in society and the world of finance
incapable as it was thought of a dishonest deed
sir john dene paul had inherited a baronetcy from his father together with an honoured name
he was himself a prominent member of the low church of austere piety
active in all good works
mister bates had been confidential managing clerk and was taken into the firm not alone as a reward for long and faithful service
but that he might strengthen it by his long experience and known business capacity
the bank enjoyed an excellent reputation it had a good connection and was supposed to be perfectly sound
moreover the partners were sober steady men who paid unremitting attention to business
yet even so early as the death of the first sir john paul
the bank was insolvent
and instead of starting on a fresh life with a new name it should then and there have closed its doors
in december eighteen fifty one the balance sheet showed a deficiency of upwards of seventy thousand pounds
the bank had been conducted on false principles
it had assumed enormous responsibilities
on one side by the ownership of the mostian calliuries a valueless property
and on the other by backing up
an impecunious and rotten firm of contractors with vast liabilities and pledged to impossible works abroad
the engagements of the bank on these two heads amounting to nearly half a million of money
produced immediate embarrassment and financial distress
the bank was already insolvent
and the partners had to decide between suspending payment
or continuing to hold its head above water by flagitious processes
they chose unhappily for themselves the latter alternative
money they must have an money they raised to meet their urgent necessities upon the balances and securities deposited with them by their customers
this borrowing continued
and on such a scale
that their paper was soon at a discount
and the various discount houses would not advance sufficient sums to relieve the necessities of the bank
then it was that instead of merely pledging securities
the bank sold them outright and thus passed the rubicon of fraud
this went on for some time and might never have been discovered had some good stroke of luck provided any of the partners
with money enough to retrieve the position of the bank but that passed from bed to worse
the firm's paper went down further and further in value and application to the committee of bankers for assistance was peremptorily refused
then came a run on the bank and it was compelled to stop payment
its debts amounted to three quarters of a million
and the dividend it eventually paid
with three and twopence in the pound
but worse than the bankruptcy was the confession made by the partners in the court
they admitted that they had made away with many of the securities intrusted to their keeping
following this warrants were issued for their arrest
the specific charge being the unlawful negotiation of danish bonds and other shares belonging to the reverend doctor griffiths of rochester
to the value of twenty thousand pounds
bates was at once captured in norfolk street strand
police officers went down at night to nutfield near reigate and arrested sir john paul but allowed the prisoner to sleep there
next morning they only just saved the train to town and left sir john behind on the platform but he subsequently surrendered himself
mister strayhan was arrested at a friend's house in bryanston square
all three were tried at the central criminal court and sentenced to fourteen years transportation passing some time in newgate on root
bates the least guilty was pardoned in eighteen fifty eight
two cases of extensive embezzlement which were discovered almost simultaneously those of robson and red path
will long be remembered both within and without the commercial world
they both reproduced many of the features of the case of wats already described
but in neither did the sums misappropriateed reach quite the same high figure
but neither robson nor redpath would have been able to pursue their fraudulent designs with success had they not like watts
been afforded peculiar facilities by the slackness of system and the want of methodical administration in the concerns by which they were employed
robson was of humble origin but he was well educated and he had some literary abilities
his proclivities were theatrical and he was the author of several plays
one at least of which love and loyalty with wallock in a leading part achieved a certain success
he began life as a law writer earning thereby some fifteen or eighteen shillings a week
but the firm he served got him a situation as clark in the office of the great northern railway
whence he passed to a better position under the crystal palace company
he now married although his salary was only a pound a week but he soon got on
he had a pleasant address showed good business aptitudes and quickly acquired the approval of his superiors
within a year he was advanced to the post of chief clark in the transfer department at a salary of one hundred fifty pounds a year
his immediate chief was a mister fasson upon whose confidence he gained so rapidly through his activity industry and engaging manners
that ere long the whole management of the transferr department was intrusted to him
some time elapsed before robson succumbed to temptation
he was not the first man of loose morality and expensive tastes
who preferred to risk his future reputation and liberty to the present discomfort of living upon narrow means
the temptation was all the greater because the chances of successful fraud lay ready to hand
shares in the company were represented by certificates which often enough never left the companies or more exactly robson's hands
he conceived the idea of transferring shares fogus chairs from a person who held none to any one who would buy them in the open market
he took it for granted that the certificates representing these bogus shares and which practically did not exist would never be called for
this ingenious method of raising funds he adopted and carried on without detection
till the defalcations from fraudulent transfers and fraudulent issues combined amounted to twenty seven thousand pounds
with the proceeds of these flagitious frauds robson feasted and made merry
he kept open house at kilburn priory
entertaind literary artistic and dramatic celebrities had a smart turn out tended all the race meetings and dressed in the latest fashion
to his wife poor soul he made no pretence of fidelity and she enjoyed only so much of his company as was necessarily spent
in receiving guests at home or could be spared from two rival establishments in other parts of the town
to account for his revenues he pretended to have been very lucky on the stock exchange which was at one time true to a limited extent
and to have succeeded in other speculations
when his friends asked whyr he a wealthy man of independent means continued to slave on as a clerk on a pittance
he replied gaily that his regular work at the crystal palace office was useful as a sort of discipline and kept him steady
all this time his position was one of extreme insecurity
he was standing over a mine which at any moment might explode
the blow fell suddenly and when least expected one morning mister fasson asked casually for certain certificates
whether representing real or fictitious shares does not appear but they were certificates connected in some way with robson's long practised frauds
and he could not produce them his chief asked sternly where they were
robson said they were at kilburn priory
let us go to kilburn for them together said mister phasson growing suspicious
they drove there and robson on arrival did the honors of his house rang for lunch to gain time
but at mister fasson's pressing demands went upstairs to fetch the certificates
he came back to explain that he had mislaid them
mister passon more and more ill at ease would not accept this subterfuge and declared they must be found
robson again left him but only to gather together hastily all the money and valuables on which he could lay his hands with which he left the house
mister fasson waited and waited for his subordinate to reappear and at last discovered his flight
a reward was forthwith offered for robson's apprehension
meanwhile the absconding clerk had coolly driven to a favorite dining place in the west end
where a fish curry and a brace of partridges were set before him
and he discussed the latter with appetite but begged that they would never give him curry again as he did not like it
after dinner he went into hiding for a day or two
then accompanied by a lady not missus robson he took steamer and started for copenhagen
but the continental police had been warned to look out for him and two danish inspectors got upon his track
followed him over to sweden and arrested him at helsingforce
thence he was transferred to copenhagen and surrendered in due course to a london police officer
little more remains to be said about robson he appears to have accepted his position and to have at once resigned himself to his fate
when brought to trial he took matters very coolly and at first pleaded not guilty
but subsequently withdrew the plea
sergeant valentine who prosecuted
paid him the compliment of describing him as a young man of great intelligence considerable powers of mind
and possessed of an education very much beyond the rank of life to which he originally belonged
robson was found guilty and sentenced to two terms of transportation one for twenty and one for fourteen years
newgate officers who remember robson still describe him as a fine young man who behaved well as a prisoner
but who had all the appearance of a careless thoughtless happy go lucky fellow
in many respects the embezzlement of which leopold redpath was guilty closely resembled that of robson
but it was based upon more extended and audacious forgeries
redpath's crime arose from his peculiar and independent position as registrar of stock of the great northern railway company
this offered him great facilities for the creation of artificial stock its saild from a fictitious holder and transferred to himself
all the signatures in the transfer were forged
not only did he thus transfer and realize bogus stock
but he bought botified amounts and increase their value by altering the figures
by inserting say one before five hundred and thus making it
fifteen hundred pounds which larger amount was duly carried to his credit on the register and entered upon the certificates of transfer
by these means redpath misappropriated vast sums during a period extending over ten years
the total amount was never exactly made out but the false stock created and issued by him was estimated at two hundred twenty thousand pounds
even when the bubble burst redpath who had lived at the rate of twenty thousand a year
had assets in the shape of land house furniture pictures and objet's dart to the value of fifty thousand pounds
he began in a very small way
first a lawyer's clerk he then got an appointment in the peninsular and oriental company's office
afterwards he set up as an insurance broker on his own account but presently failed
his fault was generosity
an open handed unthinking charity which gave freely to the poor and needy the money which belonged to his creditors
after his bankruptcy he obtained a place as clark in the great northern railway office
from which he rose to be assistant registrar with the special duties of transferring shares
he soon proved his ability and by unremitting attention mastered the whole work of the office
later on he became registrar and in this more independent position
developed to a colossal extent the frauds he had already practised as a subordinate
now he launched out into great expenditure took a house in chester terrace and became known as a mescinis and patron of the arts
he had a nice taste in bric a brac and was considered a good judge of pictures
leading social and artistic personages were to be met with at his house and his hospitality was far famed
the choicest wines the finest fruits
peas at ten shillings a quart five guinea pines and early asparagus were to be found on his table
but his chief extravagance his favourite folly was the exercise of an ostentatious benevolence
the philanthropy he had displayed in a small way when less prosperous became now a passion
his name headed every subscription list his purse was always open
not content with giving where assistance was solicited he himself sought out deserving cases and personally afforded relief
when the crash came there were pensioners and other recipients of his bounty who could not believe
that so good a man had really been for years a swindler and a rogue
down at waybridge where he had a country place his name was long remembered with gratitude by the poor
during the days of his prosperity he was a governor of christ's hospital
of the saint anne's society and one of the supporters and managers of the patriotic fund
in his person he was neat and fastidious
he patronized the best tailor's and had a fashionable coiffur from hanover square daily to curl his hair
there was something dramatic in redpath's detection
just after robson's frauds had agitated the minds of all directors of companies the chairman of the great northern mister denison
was standing in a railway station talking to a certain well known peer of the realm
red path passed and lifted his hat to his chairman the latter acknowledged the salute
but the peer rushed forward and shook redpath warmly by the hand
what do you know of our clerk asked mister denison of his lordship only that he is a capital fellow who gives the best dinners and bulls in town
red path had industriously circulated reports that he had prospered greatly in speculation
but the chairman of the great northern could not realize that a clerk of the company could honestly be in the possession of unlimited wealth
it was at once decided at the board to make a thorough examination of all his books
red path was called in
and informed of the intended investigation
he tried to stave off the evil hour by declaring that everything was perfectly right
but finding he could not escape he said he would resign his post and leaving the board room disappeared
the inquiry soon revealed the colossal character of the frauds
warrants were issued for red paths to rest but he had flown to paris
thither police officers followed only to find that he had returned to london
a further search discovered him at breakfast at a small house in the new road
he was arrested examined before a police magistrate and committed to newgate
great excitement prevailed in the city and the west end when redpath's defalcations were made public
the stock market was greatly affected and society more especially that which frequents exeter hall was convulsed
the central criminal court when the trial came on
was densely crowded and many curious eyes were turned upon the somewhat remarkable man who occupied the dock
he is described by a contemporary account as a fresh looking man of forty years of age slightly bald inclined to am bon pois
and thoroughly embodying the idea of english respectability
his manner was generally self possessed but his face was marked with uneasy earnestness
and he looked about him with wayward furtive glances
when the jury found a verdict of guilty he remained unmoved he listened without emotion to the judge's well merited censures
had received his sentence of transportation for life without much surprise
red path passed away into the outer darkness of a penal colony where he was still living a year or two back
but his name lingers still in this country as that of the first swindler of his time
and the prototype of a class not uncommon in our later days
that of dishonest rogues who assume pity and philanthropy as a cloak for their misdeeds
in newgate
red path is remembered by the prison officer as a difficult man to deal with
from the moment of his reception he gave himself great airs
as a martyr
and a man heavily wronged
by and by when escape seemed hopeless and after sentence
he suddenly degenerated into the lowest stamp of criminal
and behaved so as to justify a belief that he had been a jail bird all his life
it has been already remarked in these pages that with changed social conditions came a great change in the character of crimes
highway robberies for instance had disappeared
if we accept the spasmodic and severely repressed outbreak of garroting
which at one time spread terror throughout london
thieves preferred now to use ingenuity rather than brute force
it was no longer possible to stop a coach or carriage or rob the postmen who carried the mail
the improved methods of locomotion had put a stop to these depredations
people travelled in company as a rule
only when single and unprotected
were they in any danger of attack
and that but rarely
there were still big prizes however to tempt the daring and none appealed more to the thievish instinct than the custom of transmitting gold by rail
the precious metal was sent from place to place carefully locked up and guarded no doubt
but were the precautions too minute
the vigilance too close to be eluded or overcome
this was the question which presented itself to the fertile brain of one pierce
who had been concerned in various jobs of a dishonest character
and who for the moment was a clerk in a betting office
he laid this suggestion before agar
a professional thief
who was of opinion it contained elements of success
but the collusion and active assistance of employees of the railway carriers
were indispensable and together
they sounded one burgess a guard on the south eastern railway a line by which large quantities of bullion
were sent to the continent

burgess detailed the whole system of transmission
the gold packed in an iron bound box
was securely lodged in safes
locked with
patent chubs
each safe had three sets of double keys
all held by confidential servants of the company

one pair was with the traffic superintendent in london
another with an official in folkstone
a third with the captain of the folkstone and boulogne boat
at the other side of the channel
the french railway authorities took charge
the safe swell on the line on route between london and folkstone
wer in the guards van
this was an important step
and they might easily be robbed some day when burgess was the guard
provided only that they could be opened
the next step
was to get impressions and fabricate false keys
a new accomplice was now needed within the company's establishment
and pierce looked about long before he found the right person
at last
he decided to enlist one test her
a clerk in the traffic department
whom he thought would prove a likely tool
the four waited patiently for their opportunity
which came when the safes were sent to chums to be repaired and chubs sent them back
but only with one key
in such a way that tester had possession of this key for a time
he lent it to a gar for a brief space
who promptly took an impression on wax
but the safes had a double lock
the difficulty was to get a copy of the second key
this was at length effected by agar and pierce
after hanging about the folkstone office for some time they saw at last that the key was kept in a certain cupboard
still watching and waiting for the first chance
they seized it when the clerks left the office empty for a moment
pierce boldly stepped in
found the cupboard unlocked he removed the key
handed it to agar outside
who quickly took the wax impression
handed it back to peers
peerce replaced it
left the office and the thing was done
after this nothing remained but to wait for some occasion when the amount transmitted would be sufficient to justify the risks of robbery
it was cester's business
who had access to the railway company's books to watch for this
meanwhile
the others completed their preparations with the utmost care
a weight of shot
was bought and stowed in carpet bags ready to replace exactly
the abstracted gold
courier bags were bought to carry the stuff slung over the shoulders
and last but not least agur frequently travelled up and down the line to test the false keys he had manufactured
with pierce's assistance
burgess admitted him into the guards van
where he fitted and filed the keys till they worked easily and satisfactorily in the locks of the safe
o
one night
tester whispered to agar and pierce
all right
as they cautiously lounged about london bridge
the thieves took first class tickets
handed their bags full of shot to the porters who placed them in the guard's van
just as the train was starting
agar slipped into the van
with burgess and pierce got into a first class carriage

agar at once got to work on the first safe
opened it
took out and broke into the bullion box
removed the gold
substituted the shot from a carpet bag
refastened and resealed the bullion box and replaced it in the safe
at redhill
testor met the train
and relieved the thieves of a portion of the stolen gold
at the same station
pierce joined ager in the guards van and there were now three to carry on the robbery
the two remaining sapes were attacked
and nearly entirely despoiled in the same way as the first and the contents transferred to the currier bags

the train was now approaching folkstone
and agar and pierce hid themselves in a dark part of the van
at that station the sapes were given out
heavy with shot not gold
the thieves went on to dover
and by and by
with austin tickets previously procured
returned to london without mishap
and by degrees
disposed of much of the stolen gold
the theft was discovered at boulogne
when the boxes were found not to weigh exactly what they ought
but no clue was obtained to the thieves
and the theft might have remained a mystery
but for the subsequent bad faith of peerce
to his accomplice agur
the latter was ere long arrested
on a charge of uttering forged checks

convicted
and sentenced to transportation for life
when he knew that he could not escape his fate
he handed over to pierce a sum of three thousand pounds
his own
h
whether rightly or wrongly acquired
never came out
together with the unrealized part of the bullion amounting in all to some fifteen thousand pounds
and begged his accomplice
to invest it as a settlement
on a woman named k
by whom he had had a child
pierce made kay only a few small payments
then appropriated the rest of the money
ky who had been living with agar at the time of the bullion robbery
went to the police in great fury and distress
and disclosed all she knew of the affair
ager too in newgate
heard how peerce had treated him
and at once readily turned to prover
as the evidence he gave incriminated pierce
burgess and testor
all three were arrested
and committed to newgate for trial
the whole strange story
the long incubation and the elaborate accomplishment of the plot
came out at the old bailey
and was acknowledged to be one of the most extraordinary on record
scarcely had the conviction of these daring and astute thiebes been assured
then another gigantic fraud was brought to light
the series of boldly conceived and cleverly executed forgeries
in which james townsen salwart commonly called jem the pen man
was the prime mover
has probably no parallel in the annals of crime
sawwart himself is a striking and in some respects an unique figure in criminal history
a man of birth and education
a member of the bear
and of acknowledged legal attainments

his proclivities were all downward
instead of following an honorable profession
he preferred to turn his great natural talents
and ready wits
to the most nefarious practices
he was known to the whole criminal fraternity as a high class receiver of stolen goods
a negotiator more especially of stolen paper
checks and bills
of which he made a particular use
he dealt too in the precious metals
when they had been improperly acquired
and it was to him
that agar pierce and the rest applied when seeking to dispose of their stolen bullion

but sawward's operations were mainly directed to the fabrication and uttering
afforged
checks
his method was comprehensive
and deeply laid
burglars brought him the checks they stole from houses thieves what they got in pocket books
checks blank
and cancelled were his stock in trade
the former he filled up by exact imitation of the latter
signature and all

when he could get nothing but the blank cheque
he set in motion all sorts of schemes for obtaining signatures such as
commencing sham actions and addressing formal applications merely for the reply
one stroke of luck which he turned to great account
was the return from transportation of an old pal and confederate who brought with him some bills of exchange
soward's method of negotiating the checks was equally well planned
like his great predecessor old patch he never went to a bank himself
nor did any of his accomplices
the bearer of the check was always innocent and ignorant of the fraudulent nature of the document he presented
in order to obtain messengers of this sort sowwart answered advertisements of persons seeking employment
and when these presented themselves entrusted them as a beginning with the duty of cashing cheques
a confederate followed the emissary closely
not only to ensure fair play and the surrender of the proceeds if the check was cashed but to give timely notice if it was not
so that sawward and the rest might make themselves scarce
as each transaction was carried out from a different address and a different messenger always employed
the forgers always escaped detection
but fate overtook two of the gang
partly through their own carelessness when transferring their operations to yarmouth
one named hardwick
assumed the name of ralph and to obtain commercial credit in yormouth
paid in two hundred fifty pounds to a yarmouth bank
as coming from a mister whitney
he forgot to add that it was to be placed to ralph's credit
and when he called as ralph
he was told it was only at mister whitney's disposal and that it could be paid to no one else
hardwick or ralph appealed to sawward in his difficulty
and that clever schemer sent an elaborate letter of instructions how to ask for the money
but while hardwick was in communication with sawward the bank was in communication with london
and the circumstances were deemed sufficiently suspicious to warrant the arrest of the gentlemen at yarmouth on a charge of forgery and conspiracy
sawward's letter to hardwick fell into the hands of the police and compromised him
while hardwick and atwell were in newgate awaiting trial active search was made for sowrd
who was at length taken in a coffee shop near oxford street under the name of hopkins
he resisted at first and denied his identity
but on being searched two blank cheques of the london and westminster bank were found in his pocket
he then confessed that he was the redoubtable jem sawward or jem the pen man and was conveyed to a police court and thence to newgate
at his trial
at well and hardwick two of his chief allies and accomplices turned approvers
and the whole scheme of systematic forgery was laid bare
the evidence was corroborated by that of many of the victims who had acted as messengers
and others who swore to the meetings of the conspirators and their movements
soward was found guilty
and the judge in passing sentence on him of transportation for life express deep regret that the ingenuity skill and talent
which had received so perverted and mistaken direction
had not been guided by a sense of virtue and directed to more honorable and useful pursuits
the proceeds of these forgeries amounted it was said to some thousands per annum
sawward spent all his share at low gaming houses and in all manner of debaucheries
he was in person a short square built man of gentlemanly address sharp and shrewd in conversation and manner
the chronicles of newgate volume too by arthur griffith's section nineteen
later records
the old notion always prevailed that newgate was impregnable so to speak from within
and that none of its inmates could hope to escape from its secure precincts
yet the jail
in spite of its fortress like aspect
was by no means really safe
year after year
prisoners determined to get free
and occasionally succeeded in their efforts
the inspector's reports mentioned many cases of evasion accomplished
there were others less successful
charles thomas white
awaiting execution for arson
made a desperate effort to escape from newgate in eighteen twenty seven
he had friends and auxiliaries inside the jail and out
h
the cell he occupied was near the outer wall
and had he but been able to remove its iron bars he might have descended into newgate street by means of a rope ladder
the latter was actually made
of black sewing thread firmly and closely interwoven
but white could not remove the bars
the instruments needed for the purpose never reached him
it was noticed that he was most anxious to receive a pair of shoes for which he had asked and when they arrived
they were closely examined
sown in between the upper and lower leathers several spring saws were found which would have easily cut through any bars
white when taxed with his attempt
admitted that the accusation was true and spoke with pride and satisfaction of the practicability of his scheme
there is an attempt at escape mentioned in mister wakfield's book which might have been an intended suicide
john williams a young fellow only twenty three years of age awaited execution in eighteen twenty seven for stealing in a dwelling house
on the very morning on which he was to suffer he eluded the vigilance such as it was of his officers
and climbed up the pipe of a cistern in the corner of the press yard
some thought with the idea of drowning himself
he never reached the cistern but fell back into the yard injuring his legs severely
although his execution was imminent a surgeon attended to his wounds and he was carried more dead than alive to the scaffold
a harrowing scene followed
the wounds broke open and bled profusely while the last dread penalty was being performed to the manifest excitement and indignation of the crowd
a more daring and skilful escape was effected in eighteen thirty six by the chimney sweep henry williams
who while detained in the press yard as a capital convict under sentence of death for burglary
managed to get away in the very same spot where his namesake had nine years before so miserably failed
escape seemed absolutely hopeless
and would certainly have been impossible to any one less nimble than a chimney sweep trained under the old system to ascend the most intricate flues
even after williams had got out
persons were disposed to disbelieve that the escape had been accomplished in the manner indicated
they preferred to credit it to carelessness or collusion from officers of the jail
yet from the circumstantial account given by williams after recapture there can be little doubt that he got away as will be described
williams as a capital convict was lodged in the press yard or condemned ward
he had access to the arring yard and there was for hours no kind of supervision
in one corner of the airing yard stood a cistern at some height from the ground
the war beneath
and above it was rusticated

in other words
the granite surface had become roughened
and offered a sort of foothold
about fifty feet from the ground level and above the cistern a revolving cheveau de free of iron was fixed
with only a short interval between it and the wall supported by a horizontal iron railing with upright points
in the wall above the chabeaux de freze projected a series of iron spikes sharp enough to forbid further assent
williams surveyed these formidable obstacles to evasion and calmly proceeded to surmount them
his first task was to gain the top of the cistern
this he affected by keeping his back to one side of the angle
and working with his hands behind him while he used his bare feet like claws upon the other side of the wall angle
the condition of the stone surface just mentioned assisted him in this and he managed to get beyond the cistern to the railing below the chaveau de freze
the least slip now would have been fatal to him but he could not thrust his body in through the narrow space left by the shivau de frece
and was compelled to work along the railing round three quarters of the square of the yard
and at length reached a point opposite the top of the building containing the condemned wards this had been a perilous and painful task
the spikes of the railing penetrated his flesh and made progression slow and difficult
but the worst part of the business was to jump from this irksome foothold of the iron grating on to the top of the building just mentioned
a distance of eight or nine feet
he had here completed his assent
his next job was to descend outside newgate
clambering along the roof
he passed to the top of the ordinary's residence hoping to find an open skylight by which he might enter and so work downstairs
if the worst came to the worst he intended to have gone down some chimney as he had often done before in the way of business
but he did not like the risk of entering a room by the fireplace and the chances of detection it offered
he traversed vainly all the roofs in newgate street
running a great risk of discovery as he passed by a lot of workmen at tyler's manufactory in warwick square which had formerly been the college of physicians
as his coat was an encumbrance he left it on the top of the third house in newgate street and thus in short sleeves barefoot and bareheaded
he worked along to the roofs in warwick lane
here he came upon a woman on the leads hanging out clothes to dry
williams concealed himself behind a chimney till she had re entered her garret
and then following her down a step ladder into the house told his story appealed to and one her compassion
she suffered him to pass downstairs
below
he met another woman and a girl both of whom were terrified at his appearance but
when he explained that he was running away from the gallows they left him the road clear
to walk out into the street was an easy affair and he was now free with one and fourpence in his pocket and a shirt and trousers for all his clothing
denied admission everywhere as a ragged half naked beggar
he tramped across london bridge to wandsworth where he refreshed himself with a pint of strong ale the first sustenance he had taken since his escape
and continued his march to kingston where he slept soundly under a hedge till next morning
entering a town he obtained employment at once as a chimney sweep
from a widow woman who gave him bubbin grub or food and one ind sixpence for every nine days work
dissatisfied with this remuneration he again took to the road and tramped into hampshire
where he presently committed a burglary at lymington was caught and lodged in winchester jail
mister cope the governor of newgate having been communicated with proceeded to winchester where he at once identified williams
the success although very short lived which attended him no doubt inspired other inmates of newgate to follow his example
it was for some time after this a constant practice to go up the chimneys in the hope of escaping by the flue
even then however irons across barred the ascent after a certain distance and in no one case did a fugitive get clear away
a man named leirs under sentence of transportation for an attempt at murder on board ship got up part of the way
but had to come down again covered with soot and filth just as the officers entered the ward
leirs was rewarded by being obliged to wear cross irons on his legs a punishment rarely inflicted in newgate
and probably one of the few cases of a recurrence but under proper safeguards and limitations to the old system of chains
on another occasion mister cope the governor came in and missed a man
the ward was one short of its number what had become of the fellow
the fugitive uncomfortably ensconced in the flue came down of his own accord
like colonel colt's recoon
after this great iron guards just as are to be seen in lunatic asylums
were fixed over the fireplaces and the prisoners had no longer access to the chimneys
among the escapes still remembered was one in eighteen forty nine accomplished by a man who had been employed
working at the roof of the chapel on the female side
he was engaged in whitewashing and cleaning the officer who had him in charge left him on the stairs leading to the gallery
taking advantage of being unobserved he got out through the roof on to the leads
and travelled along them towards number one newgate street
this was a public house
he stepped in at a garret window coolly walked downstairs and entered the bar
they asked him how he had cut his hand which was bleeding and he said he had done it while working up on the roof
no further notice was taken of him
no one seemingly suspected that he was a prisoner and he was suffered to walk off without let or hindrance
in eighteen fifty three three men escaped in company from one of the wards in the middle yard
they were penal servitude men their names bell brown and barry and they were awaiting transfer to leicester
which with wakefield was utilized as a receptacle for convicts not going to western australia
or any of the new establishments at home at portland dartmoor or elsewhere
these men managed to cut a hole in the ceiling of the ward near the iron cage on the landing and so got access to the roof
at that time rope mats were still used as beds
one of the three shamming ill remained all day in his ward where he employed himself onraveling the rope from the sleeping mats
by evening he manufactured a good long length
and after all was quiet the three got on to the roof through the hole and so on to tyler's manufactory close by
whence they let themselves down into the street by the rope
these men were all in prison dress at the time of their escape but one of their number bell sent back his clothes a few days later by parcel's delivery
with a civil note to the governor saying he had no further use for them
all three fugitives were recaptured
brown almost at once then barry who was taken at the east end in a public house where he had arranged to meet a pal
the newgate officers obtained information of this and went to the spot where they effected the capture
but not till they had had an exciting chase down the street
the third bell remained longest at large he too was run into at a lodging in the king'sland road
the officers dropped on to him while he was still in bed but as they came upstairs he jumped up and hid in a cupboard
all three after recapture
passed on as originally intended to leicester where they did their bit and were released
but only to be taken soon afterwards for a fresh offence and again passed through newgate with sentences of penal servitude
a later case was still more remarkable as it was effected after the alteration of the prison and its reconstruction on the newest lines
a sailor craps by name occupied one of the upper cells in the new block
the doors through incomplete knowledge of prison needs were not as now sheeted with iron
the prisoner had nothing to deal with but wooden panels and by dint of cutting and chopping he got both the lower panels out
through the aperture he crept out on to the landing at the dead of night and sewed down into the central space of the building
under superior orders all the doors and gates of this block were left open at night to allow the night watchman to pass freely to all parts
this was considered safer than intrusting him with keys
craps walked at once into the yard and across to the female side where he found some of the washings still hanging out to dry
he made a strong rope with several of the sheets then returning to the mail yard
got hold of the step ladder used in lighting the gas and which under our more careful supervision would have been as nowadays chained up
cutting the cord which fastened the two legs of the step ladder he opened them out and made one long length
with this placed against the wall near the cheveau de frize
he made an escalade
the top of the wall was gained without difficulty
along this craps crawled and then dropped down on to the cook house
he now put in requisition the rope made of the sheets and with its help lowered himself into the street
down below were market carts waiting for daylight and among them craps found a refuge and friends
the first intimation of his escape was afforded by the police who informed the prison authorities next day that a rope was hanging down from the cook house roof
nothing more was heard of crabs the curious thing in his case was that his offence was a trifling one
he was still untried but would almost certainly have escaped with a minor penalty save of three or four months imprisonment
there is however no explanation of the motives which prompt prisoners to attempt escapes
cases well authenticated have been known of men who had all but completed their sentences and for whom the prison gates would open within a few days
who yet faced extraordinary risks to advance their enlargement by only a few hours
on the other hand at the great convict establishments such as the moral restraint of a systematic discipline
that numbers of men lifers and others with ten fourteen or twenty years to do can be trusted to work out of doors without bolts and bars
at a distance from the prison
the last escape from newgate was only three years ago and occurred just before the final closing of the prison
no report of it was made public as the man was almost immediately recaptured
he was at work under the supervision of the artisan warder of the prison
who permitted him to go up on to the roof of the old wards in order to throw water for flushing purposes down a choote
he was out of sight while so employed and remained so long absent that the warder becoming uneasy went in search of him
he had disappeared
encouraged by the shouts and signals of some workmen employed on a building outside the prisoner made one of the most marvelous jumps on record
from the building he was on to a distant wall with a drop of sixty feet between
then he ran along the coping of the wall towards its angle with tyler's manufactory and dropped down on to the gridiron below
this was not strong enough to carry him and he fell through
suicides and executions were however always the most effectual methods of making exit from durance
suicides at newgate were numerous enough but they seldom possessed any novel or unusual features
prison suicides seldom do except as regards ingenuity and determination
only great resolution indeed persisted in to the bitter end
would make death a certainty so limited and imperfect are the means generally available
when a bit of rope carefully secreted
braces shoe strings shirt torn into strip are the only instruments and a bar or small hook
at no elevation affords the only drop strangulation would seldom supervene
but for the resolution of the miserable fellow de say
one curious instance of a suicide carried out under the most adverse and extraordinary circumstances may be quoted
it was that of a long firm swindler by name johnson
who contrived to hang himself from a hammockcook only eighteen inches from the ground
the noose was one of his hammock straps which he buckled round his throat
having carefully spread out a blanket on the floor just below the hammock as it lay suspended
he fastened one end of the strap above mentioned to the hook and then fell down
he might have saved himself at any moment by merely extending an arm but he lay there patiently till death supervened
when discovered next morning quite dead it was found that the strap actually did not touch his throat
three fingers might have been inserted between it and the flesh the pressure was all on the arteries behind the ears
and surgical opinion stated that the stoppage of circulation was the cause of death
probably dissolution came as easily and almost without pain
a laudable desire to invest executions with more and more solemnity and decorum gained ground as they became more rare
as more humane principles were introduced into prison management
greater attention was paid to the capital convicts and the horrors of their situation while awaiting sentence
were as far as possible mitigated and toed down
but there was little improvement in the ceremony itself
there were still untoward accidents occasionally at executions and even the chief practitioner of recent times cowcraft
was not always to be trusted to do his fell work efficiently
having mentioned kelcraft's name
i may be permitted to digress for a moment to give a few particulars concerning the last officially appointed hangman of the city of london
after cowcraft's resignation no successor was really appointed
marwood whose name is so familiar with the present generation
had no official status and was merely an operator selected by the corporation and who on the strength of it
contracted with sheriffs and conveners to work by the job
but cow craft regularly succeeded foxen who followed botting and denis the actor in the seventeen eighty ryots
cowcraft was born at bedo in essex in eighteen hundred
he was a shoemaker by trade and settled in london after his marriage in eighteen twenty five
the story goes that about eighteen twenty eight
his attention was drawn early one morning to a man who leaped against a lamp post in finsbury square coughing violently
cowcraft who in spite of the dreadful calling he subsequently followed was always reputed a kindly man
invited the man with the cough to enter a neighboring house and try a little peppermint for it
the other excepted and they got into conversation
he told celcraft that he was foxen the executioner and that he was that moment on his way to newgate to hang a man
but that his cough was getting so much the master of him that he feared he would not be able to carry on his duties much longer
i have no idea who the sheriffs will get to do the work after me said foxon adding that his assistant tom cheshire
was given to drink and not to be trusted
i think i could do that sort of job said colcraft on the spur of the moment
foxon asked him his name and address and went away
cowlcraft thought no more of what had occurred till the next sessions at the old bailey when the sheriffs sent for him
and offered him the post of executioner for the city of london and middlesex
he accepted having at first tom cheshar as his assistant then for a time when cheshire was dismissed for drunkenness a man named osborne
after that he worked alone
i cannot find that cowcraft was sworn in when appointed or any exact information when the old forbidding ceremony ceased to be practised
it was customary to make the executioner take the bible in his hand and swear solemnly that he would dispatch every criminal condemned to die
without favouring father or mother or any other relation or friend
when he had taken the oath he was dismissed with the words get thee hence wretch
cowcraft's emoluments were a guinea per week and an extra guinea for every execution
he got besides half a crown for every man he flogged
and an allowance to provide cats or birch rods
for acting as executioner of horsemonger lane jail
he received a retaining fee of five pound five shillings with the usual guinea for each job
he was also at liberty to engage himself in the country where he demanded and was paid ten pounds on each occasion
it was not always easy to get a hangman so cheap as i have already indicated on a previous page
the honos and responsibility of carrying out the sentence isf personal to the sheriff a good story is told illustrating this
some wags in scotland seized cowcraft and kept him in durance the night before the execution
meanwhile the convener or sheriff was in despair expecting that failing the executioner he would have to do the job himself
but fortunately for him
just at the last moment couwcraft was set free
cowcraft's salary was more than the proverbial thirteenpence halfpenny hangmen's wages
the origin of this expression dates it is said from the time when the scottish mark
a silver coin bearing the same relation to the scottish pound that an english shilling does to an english pound was made to pass current in england
the mark was valued at thirteenpence half penny or rather more than the shilling which from time immemorial had been the hangman's wages
that very ancient perquisite the convict's clothes was never claimed by cowcraft and it may be doubted whether he was entitled to it
on one particular occasion however he got them a gentleman whose since brought him to the gallows at maidstone
wished to do cowcraft a good turn and sent to his london tailor for a complete new suit in which he appeared at his execution
he expressly bequeathed them to cowlcraft who was graciously pleased to accept them
on another occasion an importunate person begged cowlcraft eagerly to claim his right to the clothes and give them to him
cawlcraft consented got and bestowed the clothes only to find that the person he had obliged exhibited them publicly
it may be added that of late years the clothes in which a convict has suffered are invariably burnt
capital convicts go to the gallows in their own clothing and not in prison dress unless the former is quite unfit to be worn
cowcraft shared the odium which his office not strangely has always inspired but he was admitted into the jail
which his predecessors were not and who werepaid their wages over the gate to obviate the necessity for letting them enter
to this curious etiquette was due the appointment of an official whose office has long since disappeared the yeoman of the halter
whose business it was to provide the rope and do the pinioning and who was paid a fee of five shillings
they did not dislike cowcraft however at newgate he was an illiterate simple minded man who scarcely remembered what executions he had performed
he kept no record of them and when asked questions referred to the officers of the jail
his nature must have been kindly
when he came to the prison for his wages his grandchildren often accompanied him affectionately clinging to his hands
and he owned a pet pony which would follow him about like a dog
in his own profession
he was not unskilful but he proceeded entirely by rule of thumb leaving the result very much to chance and the strength of the rope
he was so much in favor of short drops that his immediate successor marwood stigmatized him as short dropped man
marwood being on the other hand in favor of giving a man as much rope as possible
with cowcraft's method there were undoubtedly many failures and it was a common custom for him to go below the gallows
just to steady their legs a little in other words to add his weight to that of the hanging bodies
marwood till latterly seemed to have done his work more effectually and has been known to give as much as six feet fall
this generally produces instantaneous death
although cases where complete fracture of the spinal cord occurred are said to be rare
cowcraft served the city of london till eighteen seventy four when he was pensioned at the rate of twenty five shillings per week
the last execution at which he acted was that of godwin on the twenty fifth may eighteen seventy four
marwood who succeeded him and who died while these sheets were in the press was a lincolnshire man a native of horncastle
who first took to the work from free dilection
and the idea of being useful in his generation as he himself assured the writer of these pages
until the time of his death he kept a small shop close to the church in horncastle
over the door in gilt letters
were the words crown office in the window was a pile of official envelopes ostentatiously displayed
while round about were shoe strings boot laces and lasts mare wood strange to say followed the same trade as cowcraft
marwood was proud of his calling
and when questioned as to whether his process was satisfactory replied that he heard
no complaints
the strange competition amongst hundreds to succeed marwood is a strange fact too recently before the public to need mention here
it may however be remarked that the wisdom of appointing any regular hangman is very open to question
and must be strongly deprecated on moral grounds as tending to the utter degradation of one individual
possibly such changes may be introduced into the method of execution
that the ceremony may be made more mechanical thus rendering the personal intervention of a skilled functionary unnecessary
executions long continued to be in public in spite of remonstrance and reprobation
the old prejudices such as that which enlisted doctor johnson on the side of the tyburn procession still lingered and prevented any change
it was thought that capital punishment would lose its deterrant effect if it ceased to be public
and the resoundet of the penalty which in principles so many opposed would be gone
this line of argument prevailed over the manifest horrors of the spectacle
these increased as time passed
the graphic and terrible account given by charles dickens of the awful scene before horsemonger lay in jail at the execution of the mannings
has already been quoted again the concourse of people collected in front of newgate to witness the execution
simultaneously of the five pirates part of the mutinous crew of the flowery land was greater than on any previous occasion
it was a callous careless crowd of coarse minded semi brutalized folk who came to enjoy themselves
few if any showed any feeling of terror none were impressed with the solemnity or realized the warning which the sight conveyed
the upturned faces of the eager spectators resembled those of the gods at drury lane on boxing night
the crowd had come to witness a popular and gratuitous public performance better than a prize fight or a play
no notion that they were assisting at a vindication of the law filled the minds of those present with dread
on the contrary the prevailing sentiment was one of satisfaction at the success of the spectacle
the remarks heard amongst the crowd were of course approval
the reply evinced equal satisfaction and the speaker with a profane oath declared that he would like to act as jack catch to the whole lot
to the disgrace of the better educated and better bred public executions could still command the attention of curious aristocrats from the west end
at moller's execution there was great competition for front seats
and the windows of the opposite houses which commanded a good view as usual fetched high prices
as much as twenty five pounds was paid for a first floor front on this occasion
never indeed had an execution been more generally patronized
this is proved by contemporary accounts especially one graphic and realistic article which appeared in the times
and which contributed in no small degree to the introduction of private executions a great crowd was expected and a great crowd came
they collected overnight in the bright light of a november moon
they were well dressed and ill dressed old men and lads women and girls
rain fell heavily at intervals but did not thin the concourse
till three o'clock it was one long revelry of songs and laughter shouting and often quarrelling though
to do them mere justice there was at least till then a half drunken ribald gaiety among the crowd that made them all akin
there were preachers among the crowd but they could not get a patient hearing
then one struck up the hem of the promised land and the refrain was at once taken up with a mighty chorus
oh my think i've got to die
this was presently superseded by a fresh catch
mollerr muller he's the man till a diversion was created by the appearance of the gallows which was received with continuous yells
as day broke the character of the crowd was betrayed
there were but few women except of the most degraded sort the men were mostly young men
sharpers thieves gamblers betting men the outsiders of the boxing ring
bricklayers laborers dock workmen german artisans and sugar bakers
with the rakings of cheap singing halls and billiard rooms the fast young man of london
but all whether young or old men or women seemed to know nothing feel nothing to have no object but the gallows and to laugh
curse or shout as in this heaving and struggling forward they gained or lost in their strong efforts to get nearer where moler was to die
the actual execution made some impression
the crowd was for a moment awed and stilled by the quiet rapid passage from life to death
but before the slight slow vibrations of the body had well ended
robbery and violence loud laughing oaths fighting obscene conduct and still more filthy language reigned round the gallows far and near
such too the scene remained with little change or respite till the old hangman cow craft slunk again along the drop
amid hisses and sneering inquiries of what he had had to drink that morning
he after failing once to cut the rope made a second attempt more successfully and the body of muller disappeared from view
it was preposterous to claim for such a scene as this that it conveyed any great moral lesson or had any deterring influence
numbers of humane and thoughtful persons had long been convinced of this
already
the urgent necessity for abolishing public executions had been brought before the house of commons by mister hibbert
and the question as part of the whole subject of capital punishment had been referred to a royal commission in january eighteen sixty four
full evidence was taken on all points and on that regarding public executions there was a great preponderance of opinion towards their abolition
yet the witnesses were not unanimous
some of the judges would have retained the public spectacle the ordinary of newgate was not certain that public executions were not the best
another distinguished witness feared
that any secrecy in the treatment of the condemned would invest them with a new and greater interest which was much to be deprecated
foreign witnesses too were in favor of publicity
on the other hand lords cranworth and wensleydale recommended private executions so did mister spencer walpole m p
sir george grey thought there was a growing feeling in favor of executions within the prison precincts
colonel now sir edmund henderson was strongly in favor of them
based on his experience of them in western australia he not only thought them likely to be more deterrant
but believed that a public ceremony destroyed the whole value of an execution
other officials great lawyers governors of prisons and chaplains supported this view
the only doubts expressed were as to the sufficiency of the safeguards as to the certainty of death and its subsequent publication
but these it was thought might be provided by the admission of the press and the holding of a coroner's inquest
duly impressed with the weight of evidence in favor of abolition
the commission recommended that death sentences should be carried out within the jail under such regulations as might be considered necessary
to prevent abuse and satisfy the public that the law had been complied with
but it is curious to note
that there were several dissentions among the commissioners to this paragraph of the report
the judge of the admiralty court the right honorable stephen lushington the right honourable james monk criif
lord advocate mister charles neet mister william yewert and last but not least mister john bright
declared that they were not prepared to agree to the resolution respecting private executions
nevertheless in the very next session
a bill was introduced by mister hibbert m p and accepted by the government providing for the future carrying out of executions within prisons
it was read for the first time in march eighteen sixty six but did not become law till eighteen sixty eight
the last public execution in front of newgate was that of the fenian michael barrett
who was convicted of complicity in the clerkenwell explosion intended to effect the release of burke and casey
from clerkenwell prison by which many persons lost their lives
unusual precautions were taken upon this occasion as some fresh outrage was apprehended
there was no interference with the crowd which collected as usual although not to the customary extent
but newgate and its neighborhood was carefully held by the police both city and metropolitan
in the houses opposite the prison numbers of detectives mixed with the spectators
inside the jail was colonel fraser the chief commissioner of the city police and at no great distance although in the background
troops were held in readiness to act if required everything passed off quite quietly however
and cowlcraft who had been threatened with summary retribution if he executed barrett carried out the sentence without mishap
the sufferer was stolid and reticent to the last
the first private execution under the new law took place within the precincts of maidstone jail
the sufferer was a porter on the london chatham and dover railway sentenced to death for shooting the station master at dover
the ceremony which was witnessed by only a few officials and representatives of the press was performed with the utmost decency and decorum
a fact duly advertised as completed by the hoisting of the black flag over the jail
had undoubtedly a solemn impressive effect upon those outside
the same was realized in the first private execution within newgate
that of alexander mackay who murdered his mistress at norton fulgate by beating her with a rolling pin and furnace rake
and who expiated his crime on the eighth september eighteen sixty eight
a more market change from the old scene can hardly be conceived instead of the roar of the brutalized crowd
the officials spoke in whispers there was but little moving to and fro
almost absolute silence prevailed until the great bell began to toll its deep note and broke the stillness with its regular and monotonous clangor
and the ordinary in a voice trembling with emotion
read the burial service aloud
mackay's fortitude which had been great
broke down at the supreme moment before the horror of the stillness the awful impressiveness of the scene in which he was the principal actor
no time was lost in carrying out the dread ceremony but it was not completed without some of the officials turning sick and the moment it was over
all who could were glad to escape from the last act of the ghastly drama at which they had assisted
private executions at their first introduction were not popular with the newgate officials and for intelligible reasons
the change added greatly to the responsibilities of the governor and his subordinates hitherto the public had seemed to assist at the ceremony
the moment too that the condemned man had passed through the debtors doors on to the scaffold the prison had done with him
and the great outside world shared in the completion of the sacrifice
this feeling was the stronger because
all the ghastly paraphernalia the gallows itself and the process of erecting and removing it rested with the city architect and not with the prison officials
moreover after the execution under the old system the latter had only to receive the body for burial after it had been cut down by the hangman
and placed decently in a shell by the workmen who removed the gallows
under the new system the whole of the arrangements from first to last fell upon the officers
it was they who formed the chief part of the small select group of spectators
upon them devolved the painful duty of cutting down the body and preparing for the inquest
all that the hangmen whoever he may be does under the new regime is to unhook the halter and remove the pinioning straps
the interment in a shell filled with quicklime in the passageway leading to the old bailey is also a part of the duty of the prison officials
and for the greater security of prisoners it is roofed in with iron bars which gives it at least overhead the aspect of a huge cage
underfoot and upon the walls roughly cut into the stones are single initial letters the brief epithephs of those who lie below
as this burial ground leads to the adjacent central criminal court accused murderers on going to and returning from trial
literally walked over what in case of conviction would be their own graves
the older officers with several of whom i have conversed have thus had unusual opportunities of watching the demeanor of murderers both before trial
and after sentence
all as a rule unless poignant remorse has brought a desire to court their richly merited retribution are buoyed up
with hope to the last there is always the chance of a flaw in the indictment of a missing witness or extenuating circumstances
even when in the condemned cell with a shameful death within measurable distance
many cling still to life expecting much from the intercession of friends or the humanitarianism of the age
all almost without exception sleeps soundly at night except the first after sentence
when the first shock of the verdict and a solemn notification of the impending blow keeps nearly all awake or at least disturbs their night's rest
but the uneasiness soon wears off
the second night sleep comes readily and as sound
many of the most abandoned murderers snore peacefully their eight hours even on the night immediately preceding execution
all two have a fairly good appetite and eat with relish up to the last moment
a few go further and are almost gluttonous
giovanni lanney the italian boy who murdered a frenchwoman in the haymarket
and was arrested on board ship just as he was about to leave the country had a little spare cash which he devoted entirely to the purchase of extra food
he ate constantly and voraciously after sentence as though eager to cram as many meals as possible into the few hours still left him to live
geoffrey who murdered his own child an infant of six by hanging him in a cellar in seven dials
called for a roast duck directly he entered the condemned cell
the request was not granted as the old custom of allowing capital convicts whatever they asked for the way of food has not been the rule in newgate
the diet of the condemned is the ordinary diet of the prison
but to which additions are sometimes made chiefly of stimulants if deemed necessary by the medical officer of the jail
the craving for tobacco which so dominates the habitual smoker often leads the convicted to plead hard for a last smoke
as a special favor
wainwright was allowed a cigar the night before execution which he smoked in the prison yard walking up and down with the governor mister sidney smith
wainwright's demeanor was one of reckless effrontery steadily maintained to the last
his conversation turned always upon his influence over the weaker sex and the extraordinary success he had achieved
no woman could resist him he calmly assured mister smith that night as they walked together and he recounted his villainies one by one
his effrontery was only outdone by his cool contempt for the consolations of religion
the man who had made a pious life a cloak for his misdeeds the once exemplary young man an indefatigable sunday school teacher
went impenitent to the gallows the only sign of feeling he showed was in asking to be allowed to choose the hymns on the sunday
the condemned sermon was preached in the prison chapel and this was probably only that he might hear the singing of a lady with a magnificent voice
who generally attended the prison services
during the singing of these hymns wainwright fainted but whether from real emotion or the desire to make a sensation was never exactly known
on the fatal morning he came gaily out of his cell
nodded pleasantly to the governor who stood just opposite
and then walked briskly towards the execution shed smiling as he went along
there was a smile on his face when it was last seen and just as the terrible white cap was drawn over it
wainwright's execution was within the jail but only nominally private
no less than sixty seven persons were present admitted by special permission of the sheriff
romor even went so far as to assert that among the spectators were several women disguised in male habiliments
but the story was never substantiated and we may hope that it rested only on the idle gossip of the day
many like wainwright were calm and imperturbable throughout their trying or deal
catherine wilson the poisoner was reserved and reticent to the last expressing no contrition but also no fear
a tall gaunt repulsive looking woman who no more shrank from cowardly secret crimes than from the penalty they entailed
kate webster who was tried at the central criminal court and passed through newgate although she suffered at wandsworth
is remembered at the former prison as a defiant
brutal creature who showed no remorse but was subject to fits of ungovernable passion when she broke out into language the most appalling
the man morally displayed fortitude of a less repulsive kind he acknowledged his guilt from the first
when the sheriff offered him counsel for his defence he declined saying he wished to make none
the witnesses for the prosecution spoke the truth
during the trial and after sentence he remained perfectly cool and collected
when visited one day in the condemned cell just as saint sepulchre's clock was striking he looked up and said laughingly go along clark
come along gallows
he tripped up the chapel stairs to hear the condemned sermon and came out with cheerful alacrity on the morning he was to die
some condemned convicts converse but little with the warders who have them unceasingly in charge
others talk freely enough on various topics but principally upon their own cases
when vanity is strongly developed
there is the keen anxiety to hear what is being said about them outside
one was vexed to think that his victims had a finer funeral than he would have
the only subject another showed any interest in
was the theatres and the new pieces that were being produced
a third christian sattler
laughed and jested with the officers about jack ketch who
through the postponement of the execution
would lose his christmas dinner
when they brought in the two watchers to relieve guard one night satler said
two fresh men may i speak to them
yes i must caution you he went on to the warders not to go to sleep
or i shall be off through that little hole
pointing to an aperture for ventilating the cell
on the morning of execution he asked how far it was to the gallows and was told it was quite close
that the convict's clothes were still the executioner's perquisite
often the convicts give way to despair they are too closely watched to be allowed to do themselves much mischief or suicides would probably be more frequent
but it is neither easy to obtain the instruments of self destruction nor to elude the vigilance of their guard
the man bowesfield however whose execution was so sadly bungled
made a determined effort to burn himself to death by throwing himself bodily
on to the fire in the condemned ward
he was promptly rescued from his perilous condition but not before his face and hands were badly scorched
they were still much swollen when he was led out to execution
miller the chelsea murderer who packed his victim's body in a box and tried to send it by parcel's delivery tried to kill himself
but ineffectively
by running his head against his cell wall
the chronicles of newgate volume two by arthur griffith's section twenty newgate notorieties part one
as these records draw to a close the crimes i chronicle becomes so much more recent in date that they will be fresh in the memory of most of my readers
nevertheless in order to give completeness to the picture
i have attempted to draw of crime in connection with newgate from first to last i must make some mention in this my penultimate chapter
of some of the most heinous offenses of modern times
the crime of poisoning has always been viewed with peculiar loathing and terror in this country
it will be remembered that as far back as the reign of henry the h a new and most cruel penalty was devised for the punishment of the bishop of rochester's cook
who had poisoned his master and many of his dependants
sir thomas overbury was undoubtedly poisoned by lord rochester in the reign of james the first
and it is hinted that james himself nearly fell a victim to a nefarious attempt of the duke of buckingham
but secret poisoning on a wholesale scale such as was practised in italy and france was happily never popularized in england
the well known and leetel aqua tuphenea
so called after its inventress a roman woman named tofana and which was so widely adopted by ladies anxious to get rid of their husbands
was never introduced into this country
its admission was probably checked by the increased vigilance at the custom houses
the necessity for which was urged by mister addison when secretary of state in seventeen seventeen
the cases of poisoning in the british calendars are rare nor indeed was the guilt of the accused always clearly established
it is quite possible that katharine blandy
who poisoned her father at the instigation of her lover
was ignorant of the destructive character of the powders probably arsenic which she administered
captain donellin who was convicted of poisoning his brother in law sir theodosius broughton
and executed for it
would probably have had the benefit in these days of the doubts raised at his trial
a third case more especially interesting to us as having passed through newgate
was that of eliza finning who was convicted of an attempt to poison a whole family
by putting arsenic in the dumplings she had prepared for them the charge rested entirely on circumstantial evidence
and as fenning although convicted and executed protested her innocence in the most solemn manner to the last
the justice of the sentence was doubted at the time
yet it was clearly proved that the dumplings contained ar cynic and that she and she alone had made the dough
that arsenic was within her reach in the house
that she had had a quarrel with her mistress and that the latter with all others who tasted the dumplings were similarly attacked although no one died
the crime of poisoning is essentially one which will be most prevalent in a high state of civilization
when the spread of scientific knowledge places nefarious means at the disposal of many
instead of limiting them as in the days of the bourgieas and brinvilliers to the specially informed and unscrupulously powerful few
the first intimation conveyed to society of the new terror which threatened it was in the arrest and arraignment of william palmer
a medical practitioner charged with doing to death persons who relied upon his professional skill
the case contained elements of much uncertainty and yet it was so essential
in the interests and for the due protection of the public that the fullest and fairest inquiry should be made
that the trial was transferred to the central criminal court
under the authority of an act passed on purpose known as the trial of offences act and sometimes as lord campbell's act
that the administration of justice should never be interfered with by local prejudice or local feeling
is obviously of paramount importance and the powers granted by this act have been frequently put in practice since
the trial of catharine windsor the baby farmer
was thus brought to the central criminal court from exeter assizes and that of the stauntons from maidstone
palmer's trial caused the most intense excitement
the direful suspicions which surrounded the case filled the whole country with uneasiness and misgiving
and the deepest anxiety was felt that the crime if crime there had been should be brought home to its perpetrator
the central criminal court was crowded to suffocation
great personages occupied seats upon the bench
the rest of the available space was allotted by ticket
to secure which the greatest influence was necessary
people came to stare at the supposed cold blooded prisoner
with morbid curiosity to scan his features and watch his demeanour through the shifting nicely balanced phases of his protracted trial
palmer who was only thirty one at the time of his trial was in appearance short and stout with a round head
covered rather scantily with light sandy hair
his skin was extraordinarily fair
his cheeks fresh and ruddy
although his face though commonplace was not exactly ugly
there was certainly nothing in it which indicated cruel cunning or deliberate truculence
his features were not careworn but rather set and he looked older than his age
throughout his trial he preserved an impassive countenance but he clearly took a deep interest in all that passed
although the strain lasted fourteen days he showed no signs of exhaustion either physical or mental
on returning to jail each day he talked freely and without reserve to the warders in charge of him chiefly on incidents in the day's proceedings
he was confident to the very last that it would be impossible to find him guilty
even after sentence and until within a few hours of execution he was buoyed up with the hope of reprieve
the conviction that he would escape had taken so firm a hold of him
that he steadily refused to confess his guilt lest it should militate against his chances
in the condemned cell he frequently repeated quote
i go to my death a murdered man and quote
he made no distinct admissions even on the scaffold
but when the chaplain at the last moment exhorted him to confess
he made use of the remarkable words quote if it is necessary for my soul's sake to confess this murder
i ought also to confess the others i mean my wife and my brothers and quote
yet he was silent when specifically pressed to confess that he had killed his wife and his brother
palmer was ably defended but the weight of evidence was clearly with the prosecution led by sir alexander cockburn
and public opinion at the termination of the trial coincided with the verdict of the jury
originally a doctor in practice at ruggly in staffordshire he had gradually withdrawn from medicine and devoted himself to the turf
but his sporting operations did not prosper and he became a needy man always driven to desperate straits for cash
to meet his liabilities he raised large sums on forged bills of acceptance drawn upon his mother a woman of some means
whose signature he counterfeited
in eighteen fifty four he owed a very large sum of money but he was temporarily relieved by the death of his wife
whose life he had insured for thirteen thousand pounds
there is every reason to suppose that he poisoned his wife to obtain possession of this sum upon her death
his brother was supposed to have been his next victim upon whose life he had also effected an insurance for another thirteen thousand pounds
the brother too died conveniently but the life office took some exception to the manner of death and hesitated to disperse the funds claimed by palmer
halmer tried to get a new insurance on the life of a hanger on one bates but no office would accept it no doubt greatly to bates his longevity
the bill discounters who held the forged acceptances with other promissory notes began to clamor for payment and talk of issuing writs
palmer alive to the danger he ran of a prosecution for forgery should the fraud he had committed be brought to light
sought about for a fresh victim to supply him with funds
he fixed upon a sporting friend mister john parson's cook who had been in lock at shrewsbury races both as a winner and a backer
whom he persuaded to go and stay at ruggly in an hotel just opposite his own house
it was there that cook was first taken ill with violent wretchings and vomitings all dating from visits of palmer who brought him medicines and food
palmer's plan
was to administer poison in quantities insufficient
to cause death
but enough to produce illness which would account for death
for this purpose he gave
or there was the strongest presumption that he gave
antimony which caused cook's constant sickness
quantities of antimony were found in the body after death
while cook lay ill palmer in his name pocketed the proceeds of the shrewsbury settling
and so got the money for which he was prepared to barter his soul
the last act now approached and in order to avoid the detection of this last fraud
palmer laid his plans for disposing of cook
he decided to use strychnia or the vegetable poison otherwise known as knox bomica
and one of the many lynx in the long chain of evidence was an entry in a book of palmers to the effect that quote
stryccnia kills by causing titanic fixing of the respiratory muscles and quote
the purchase by palmer of stryckhnia was proved
the night he bought it cook who had been taking certain pills under medical advice not palmer's was seized with violent convulsions
he had swallowed his pills as usual at least palmer had administered them
whether the ordinary or his own pills will never be known except as may be inferred from the results which indicate that he had taken the latter
cook recovered this time it was probably palmer's intention that he should recover wishing to encourage the supposition that cook was in a bad way
next night cook had a second and more violent attack
that day palmer had bought more strychnia and had called in a fresh doctor
the second attack was fatal and ended in cook's death from tetanus
this tecnus according to the prosecution was produced by strychnia and followed the administration of pills by palmer
prescribed nominally by the fresh doctor for which palmer had substituted his own
cook's death was horrible
fearful paroxysms and cramps ending in suffocation by the titanic rigour which caught the muscles of the chest
after cook's death his stepfather who was much attached to him came to ruggily
he was struck with the appearance of the corpse which was not emaciated as after a long disease ending in death
while the muscles of the fingers were tightly clenched not open as usual in a corpse
he said nothing but began to feel uneasy when he found that cook's betting book was missing and that palmer put it forward
that his friend had died greatly embarrassed with bills to the amount of four thousand pounds out in his name
palmer too showed an indecent haste in preparing the body for interment and in obtaining the usual certificate
after this the step father insisted upon a post mortem which was conducted somewhat carelessly
the intestines were however preserved and sent for analysis
but it was proved that palmer tried hard to get possession of the jar containing them
and even sought to upset the vehicle by which they were being conveyed a part of the way to london
the examination of the stomach betrayed the presence of antimony in large quantities but no strychnia
and it was on the entire absence of the latter that the defence was principally based when palmer was brought to trial
all the circumstances were so suspicious that he could not escape the criminal charge
he had already been arrested on a writ issued at the instance of the money lenders and an action had been commenced against missus palmer on her acceptances
it came out at once that these had been forged and the whole affair at once took the ugliest complexion
a government prosecution was instituted and palmer was brought to newgate for trial at the central criminal court
there was not much reserve about him when there
he frequently declared before and during the trial that it would be impossible to find him guilty
he never actually said that he was not guilty but he was confident he would not be convicted
he relied on the absence of the strychnia
but the chain of circumstantial evidence was strong enough to satisfy the jury who agreed to their verdict in an hour
at the last moment palmer tossed a bit of paper over to his council on which he had written quote i think there will be a verdict of not guilty and quote
even after the death sentence had been passed upon him he clung to the hope that the government would grant him a reprieve
to the last therefore he played the part of a man wrongfully convicted and did not abandon hope
even when the high sheriff had told him there was no possibility of a reprieve and within a few hours of execution
he suffered at stafford in front of the jail
palmer speedily found imitators
within a few weeks occurred the leeds poisoning case in which the murderer undoubtedly was inspired by the facts made public at palmer's trial
dove a fiendish brute found from the evidence in that case that he could kill his wife whom he hated
with exquisite torture and with a poison that would leave as he thought no trace
in the latter hope he was happily disappointed
but as this case is beyond my subject i merely mention it as one of the group already referred to
three years later came the case of doctor smethurst
presenting still greater features of resemblance with palmers for both were medical men and both raised difficult questions of medical jurisprudence
in both the jury had no doubt as to the guilt of the accused only in smithurst's case the then home secretary sir george cornwall lewis
could not divest his mind of serious doubt and of which the murderer got the benefit
smadthurst's escape may have influenced the jury in the poplar poisoning case
which followed close on its heels although in that the verdict of not guilty was excusable as the evidence was entirely circumstantial
there was no convincing proof that the accused had administered the poison although beyond question that poison had occasioned the death
doctor smithhurst was long an inmate of newgate and was tried at the central criminal court
he had all the characteristics of the poisoner the calm deliberation
he protracted dissimulation as with unshrinking relentless wickedness the deadly work is carried on to the end
smathurst's victim
was a miss banks with whom he had contracted a bigamous marriage
he had met her at a boarding house where he lived with his own wife a person of shady antecedents
and whom he left without scruple to join miss banks
the latter seems to have succumbed only too willingly to his fascinations and to have as readily agreed to marry him
in spite of the existence of the other missus smathurst
probably the doctor had told her the story he brought forward when tried for bigamy namely
that missus smithurst had no right to the name but had a husband of her own one johnson alive a story subsequently disproved
miss banks seems to have counted upon some species of whitewashing no less than the repudiation of the other marriage
and told her sister as much when they last met
for some months smithhurst and miss banks lived together as man and wife first in london and then at richmond
she had a little fortune of her own some one thousand seven hundred pounds or one thousand eight hundred pounds
and a life interest in five thousand pounds a fact on which smithurst's counsel dwelt with much weight
as indicating a motive for keeping her alive rather than killing her
but probably the lump sum was the bait or perhaps smitherst wish to return to his temporarily deserted first wife
whatever the exact cause which impelled him to crime it seems certain that he began to give her some poison
either arsenic or antimony or both in small quantities
with the idea of subjecting her to the irritant poison slowly but surely until the desired effect death was achieved
as she became worse and worse smithurst called in the best medical advice in richmond
but was careful to prime them with his facts and lead them if possible to accept his diagnosis of the case
smithhurst was found guilty by the jury and sentenced to death
but a long public discussion followed and in consequence he was reprieved
the home secretary in a letter to the lord chief baron stated that quote
although the facts are full of suspicion against smithurst
there is not absolute and complete evidence of his guilt and quote
smithhurst was therefore given a free pardon for the offence of murder
but he was subsequently again tried for bigamy and sentenced to twelvemonth's imprisonment
catherine wilson was a female poisoner who did business wholesale
she was tried in april eighteen sixty two on suspicion of having attempted to poison a neighbor with oil of vitriol
the circumstances were strange missus wilson had gone to the chemist's for medicine
and on her return had administered a dose of something which burnt the mouth badly but did not prove fatal
wilson was acquitted on this charge
but other suspicious facts cropt up while she was in newgate
it appeared that several persons with whom she was intimate had succumbed suddenly
in all cases the symptoms were much the same
vomiting violent wretching purging such as are visible in cholera and all dated from the time when she knew a young man named dixon
who had been in the habit of taking colchicum for rheumatism missus wilson heard then casually from a medical man
that it was a very dangerous medicine and she profited by what she had heard
soon afterwards dixon died showing all the symptoms already described
soon afterwards a friend missus atkinson came to london from westmoreland and stayed in missus wilson's house
she was in good health on leaving home and had with her a large sum of money
while with missus wilson she became suddenly and alarmingly ill and died in great agony
her husband who came up to town would not allow a post mortem and again missus wilson escaped
missus atkinson's symptoms had been the same as dixon's then missus wilson went to live with a man named taylor
who was presently attacked in the same way as the others but but thanks to the prompt administration of remedies he recovered
after this came the charge of administering oil of vitriol which failed as has been described
last of all missus wilson poisoned her landlady missus solmes under precisely the same conditions as the foregoing
here however the evidence was strong and sufficient
it was proved that missus wilson had given missus solmes something peculiar to drink
that immediately afterwards missus solmes was taken ill with vomiting and purging
and that missus wilson administered the same medicine again and again
the last time missus solmes showed great reluctance to take it but wilson said it would certainly do her good
this mysterious medicine wilson kept carefully locked up and allowed no one to see it
but its nature was betrayed when this last victim also died
the first post mortem indicated death from natural causes
but a more careful investigation attributed it beyond doubt to over doses of colchicum
doctor alfred taylor the great authority and writer on medical jurisprudence corroborated this and in his evidence on the trial
fairly electrified the court
by declaring it his opinion
that many deaths
supposed to be from cholera
were really due to poison
this fact was referred to by the judge in his summing up
who said that he feared it was only too true
that secret poisoning was at that time very rife in the metropolis
wilson was duly sentenced to death
and suffered
impenitent
hardened
and without any confession of her guilt
although murdered by insidious methods had become more common
cases where violence of the most deadly and determined kind was offered
had not quite disappeared
i will mention two cases of this class
one accompanied with piracy on the high seas
the other perpetrated in a railway carriage and showing the promptitude with which criminals accept and utilize altered conditions of life
more particularly as regards locomotion
the first case was that of the flowering land
which left london for singapore on the twenty eighth july
eighteen sixty three
with a cargo of wine and other goods
her captain was john smith
the first and second mates
carswell and taffir
there were two other englishmen on board
and the rest of the crew were a pollyblot lot
most of them
as was proved by their subsequent acts
blaggards of the deepest dye
six were spaniards or rather natives of manila and men of color
one was a greek
another a turk
there were also a frenchman
a norwegian the carpenter
three chinamen
as clavonian
and a black on board
navigation and discipline could not be easy with such a nondescript crew
the captain was kindly
but somewhat intemperate
the first mate a man of some determination
and punishment such as ropes ending and tying to the bulwarks had to be applied
to get the work properly done
the six spaniards the greek and the turk
were in the same watch
eight truculent and reckless scoundrels who
brooding over their fancied wrongs and burning for revenge
hatched amongst them a plot to murder their officers and seize the ship
the mutiny was organized with great secrecy
and broke out most unexpectedly in the middle of the night
a simultaneous attack was made upon the captain and the first mate
the latter had the watch on deck
one half of the mutineers fell upon him unawares with handspikes and capstan bars
he was struck down imploring mercy
but they beat him about the head and face
till every feature was
bliterated
and then
still living
flung him
into the sea
meanwhile the captain roused from his birth
came out of the cabin
was caught near the companion
by the rest of the mutineers
and promptly despatched with daggers
his body was found lying in a pool of blood
in a night dress
stabbed over and over again in the left side
the captain's brother a passenger on board the flowery land
was also stabbed to death
and his body thrown overboard
the second mate
who had heard the hammering of the capstan bars and the handspikes
with the first mates and captains agonized cries
had come out
verified the murderers and then
shut himself up in his cabin
he was soon summoned on deck
but as he would not move
the mutineers came down and stood in a circle round his berth
leon or a lion's
who spoke english
when asked
said they would spare his life if he would navigate the ship for them
to the river plate
or buenos ayres
taffir the second mate agreed
but constantly went in fear of his life for the remainder of the voyage
and although the mutineers spared him
they ill treated the chinaman
and cut one badly with knives
immediately after the murder
cases of champagne which formed part of the cargo
were brought on deck and broached
the captain's cabin ransacked
his money and clothes divided amongst the mutineers as well as much of the merchandise on board
leon wished to make everyone on board share and share alike
so as to implicate the innocent with the guilty
but
vertos
or watto the turk
would not allow any but the eight mutineers to have anything
the murders were perpetrated on the tenth september
and the ship continued her voyage for nearly three weeks
meeting and speaking one ship only
on the second october they sighted land
ten miles distant
the mutineers took command of the ship
put her about till nightfall
by which time they had scuttled her
got out the boats and all left the ship
the rest of the crew were also permitted to embark
except the chinaman
one of whom was thrown into the water and drowned
while the other two were left to go down in the ship
and were seen clinging to the tops
until the waters closed over them
the boats reached the shore on the fourth october
leon had prepared a plausible tale to the effect that they belonged
to an american ship
from peru
bound to bordeaux which had found her at sea
that they had been in the boats five days and nights
but that the captain and the others had been lost
the place at which they landed was not far from the entrance to the river plate
a farmer took them in for the night
and drove them next day to rocha
a place north of maldonado
taffier the mate
finding there was a man who could speak english at another place twenty miles off
repaired there secretly and so gave information
to the brazilian authorities
the mutineers were arrested
the case inquired into by a naval court martial
and the prisoners eventually surrendered to the british
uthorities
brought to england
and lodged in newgate
their trial followed at the central criminal court
eight were arraigned at the same time
six spaniards
leon
blanco
dorano
santos
and marselino
vartos the turk
and carlos the greek
seven were found guilty of murder on the high seas and one
cardlos
acquitted
two of the seven
santos and marsolino
were reprieved
and their sentences commuted to penal servitude for life
the remaining five were executed in one batch
they were an abject miserable crew
cowards at heart
but some
especially lopez
continued bloodthirsty to the last
lopez took a violent dislike
to the officer of the ward in charge of them
and often expressed a keen desire to do for him
they none of them
spoke much english except leon
commonly called lions
after condemnation
as the rules now kept capital convicts strictly apart
they could not be lodged in the two condemned cells
and they were each kept in an ordinary separate cell
of the newly constructed block with the traps or square openings in the cell door
let down
a full view of them was thus at all times obtainable
by the officers who without intermission
day and night patrolled the ward
on the morning of execution
the noise of fixing the gallows in the street outside
awoke one or two of them
lions asked the time
and was told it was only five
ah he remarked
they will have to wait for us then till eight
lopez was more talkative
when the warder went in to call him
he asked for his clothes
he was told he would have to wear his own
then he wanted to know when the policeman would arrive and was told none would come
the soldiers then
no soldiers either
the convicts were pinioned one by one
and sent singly out to the gallows
as the first to appear would have some time to wait for his fellows a difficult and painful ordeal
the seemingly most courageous was selected to lead the way
this was dorano
but the sight of the heaving mass
uplifted impassioned faces
was too much for his nerves and he so nearly fainted
that he had to be seated in a chair
the chronicles of newgate volume two by arthur griffiths section twenty one newgate notorieties part two
in july eighteen sixty four occurred the murder of mister briggs a gentleman advanced in years and chief clark in robart's bank
as the circumstances under which it was perpetrated were somewhat novel
and as some time elapsed before the discovery and apprehension of the supposed murderer
the public mind was greatly agitated by the affair for several months the story of the murder must be pretty familiar to most of my readers
mister briggs left the bank one afternoon as usual dined with his daughter at peckham
then returned to the city to take the train from fen church street home travelling by the north london railway
he lived at hackney but he never reached it alive
when the train arrived at hackney station a passenger who was about to enter one of the carriages found the cushions soaked with blood
inside the carriage was a hat a walking stick
and a small black leather bag
about the same time a body was discovered on the line near the railway bridge by victoria park
it was that of an aged man whose head had been battered in by a life preserver
there was a deep wound just over the ear the skull was fractured and there were several other blows and wounds on the head
strange to say the unfortunate man was not yet dead and he actually survived more than four and twenty hours
his identity was established by a bundle of letters in his pocket which bore his full address
t briggs esquire robarts and company
lombard street
the friends of mister briggs were communicated with and it was ascertained that when he left home the morning of the murderous attack
he wore gold rimmed eye glasses and a gold watch and chain
the stick and bag were his but not the hat
a desperate and deadly struggle must have taken place in the carriage and the stain of a bloody hand marked the door
the facts of the murder and its object robbery were thus conclusively proved
it was also easily established that the hat found in the carriage had been bought at walkers a hatters in crawford street
mary le bone while within a few days mister briggs's gold chain was traced to a jewellers in cheapside
mister death who had given another in exchange for it to a man supposed to be a foreigner
more precise clues to the murderer were not long wanting indeed the readiness with which they were produced and followed up
showed how greatly the publicity and wide dissemination of the news regarding murder facilitate the detection of crime
in little more than a week a cabman came forward and voluntarily made a statement which at once drew suspicion to a german franz mula
who had been a lodger of his meulah had given the cabman's little daughter a jeweler's cardboard box bearing the name of mister death
a photograph of muler shone the jeweler was identified as the likeness of the man who had exchanged mister briggs's chain
last of all the cabman swore that he had bought the very hat found in the carriage for muler at the hatters walkers of crawford street
this fixed the crime pretty certainly upon muler who had already left the country thus increasing suspicion under which he lay
there was no mystery about his departure he had gone to canada by the victoria sailing ship starting from the london docks and bound to new york
directly the foregoing facts were established a couple of detective officers armed with a warrant to arrest muler
and accompanied by mister death the jeweller and the cabman went down to liverpool and took the first steamer across the atlantic
this was the city of manchester which was expected to arrive some days before the victoria and did so
the officers went on board the victoria at once muller was identified by mister death and the arrest was made
in searching the prisoner's box mister briggs's watch was found wrapped up in a piece of leather
and muler at the time of his capture was actually wearing mister briggs's hat cut down and somewhat altered
the prisoner was forthwith extra dited and sent back to england which he reached with his escort on the seventeenth september the same year
his trial followed at the next sessions of the central criminal court and ended in his conviction
the case was one of circumstantial evidence but as sir robert colliur the solicitor general pointed out
it was the strongest circumstantial evidence which had ever been brought forward in a murder case
it was really evidence of facts which could not be controverted or explained away
there was the prisoner's poverty his inability to account for himself on the night of the murder and his possession of the property of the murdered man
and alibi was set up for the defence but not well substantiated and the jury without hesitation returned a verdict of guilty
muler protested after sentence of death had been passed upon him that he had been convicted on a false statement of facts
he adhered to this almost to the very last his case had been warmly espoused by the society for the protection of germans in this country
and powerful influence was exerted both here and abroad to obtain a reprieve
muler knew that any confession would ruin his chances of escape
his arguments were specious and evasive when pressed to confess
why should man confess to man he replied
man cannot forgive man only god can do so man is therefore only accountable to god
but on the gallows when the cap was over his eyes and the rope had been adjusted round his neck and within a second of the moment when he would be launched into eternity
he whispered in the ear of the german pastor who attended him on the scaffold
while in the condemned cell he conversed freely with the warders in broken english or through an interpreter
he is described as not a bad looking man with a square german type of face
blue eyes which were generally half closed and very fair hair
he was short in stature his legs were light for the upper part of his body which was powerful almost herculean
it is generally supposed that he committed the murder under a sudden access of covetousness and greed
he saw mister briggs's watch chain and followed him instantly into the carriage determined to have it at all costs
his crime under this aspect of it was less premeditated and less atrocious therefore than that of le froy
one other curious murder may be added to the two foregoing
christian satler was by birth a german
he had led a wild life had left his native land and enlisted first in the french army in algeria
afterwards in the british german legion raised for the crimean war
at the disbandment of the force as he was without resources he turned his attention to hotel robberies by which he lived for some years
he at length stole a carpet bag containing valuables and fled to hamburg
thither he was pursued by a detective officer
inspector thayne who being unable to obtain his extradition legally had him inveigled on board an english steamer
where the arrest was made
setler was ironed for safe custody
a proceeding which he vehemently resented and begged that they might be removed as the handcuffs hurt his wrists
the inspector said that they could not be removed till he reached england
this reply of his contained no promise of immediate release
satler probably misunderstood and he declared that the police officer had broken faith with him having moreover stated that
while at sea the captain of the ship was responsible for the security of the prisoner
a sattler brooded over his wrongs his rage got the upper hand and he resolved to wreak it upon fame
although manacled he managed to get a pistol from his chest and load it
the next time fane entered his cabin he fired at him point blank and lodged three bullets in his breast
the unfortunate man survived till he landed but died in guy's hospital
sadler was tried for murder and convicted
his defence being that he had intended to commit suicide but that on the appearance of this officer who had wronged him
he had yielded to an irresistible impulse to kill him
sadler was a very excitable although not an ill tempered man
while in newgate awaiting trial he frequently tried to justify his murder by declaring that the police officer had broken faith with him
he would shoot any man or any policeman like a dog or any number of them who had treated him in that way
his demeanor immediately preceding his execution i have referred to in the last chapter
several cases of gigantic fraud rivalling any already recorded were brought to light between eighteen fifty six and eighteen seventy three
i propose next to describe the leading features of the most important of these
another case of long continued successful forgery was brought to light two years after the convictions of sawward and his accomplices
this conspiracy was cleverly planned but had scarcely so many ramifications as that of saward its originators were a couple of men
wagner and bateman who had already been convicted of systematic forgery and sentenced to transportation but they had been released on ticket of leave
in eighteen fifty six
as a blind for their new frauds they set up as law stationers in york buildings adelphi and at once commenced their nefarious traffic
forge checks and bills were soon uttered in great numbers as well as base coin
the police suspecting the house in york buildings put a watch on the premises which they kept up for more than a year
and thus obtained personal knowledge of all who passed in and out but without obtaining any direct evidence
at length a man was caught in the act of passing a forge check at the union bank
and recognized as one of the frequenters of the bogus law stationers his arrest led to that of others
among them was a man named chandler formerly a bill discounter by profession who by degrees to meet his extravagant expenditure
took to appropriating the bills entrusted to him and so lost his business after which he became a clerk to messrs wagner and bateman
chandler while in newgate turned informer and betrayed the whole conspiracy
besides his employers a jeweler named humphreys was in the swim at whose shop in red lions square was discovered a quantity of base gold
and silver coins with all the latest appliances for coining including those of electroplating
also a furniture dealer and one or two more commonplace robes the arch villain was never taken into custody
he like saward was an artist in penmanship
he was a german named kirk
eighty years of age who had spent his whole life in imitating other people's signatures and had acquired the most consummate skill in the practice
his copies were generally pronounced indistinguishable from and as good as the originals
the aged but weary kurp the moment the plot was discovered vanished and was never more heard of
much the same plan was adopted by these forgers as by sowrd to get their checks cashed
they advertised for clerks and employed the most likely of the applicants by sending them to the bank
it was one of these glendinning who had allowed himself to be utilized for some time in this way whose capture led to the breaking up of the gang
the principles in this conspiracy wagner and bateman were sentenced to penal servitude for life
the others to twenty and ten years
it was stated in evidence that the moneyes obtained by these forgeries amounted to eight thousand pounds or ten thousand pounds
and that the forged checks which had been presented but refused amounted to double the sum
wagner after conviction offered to reveal for a reward of three thousand pounds
a system which had long been in practice of defrauding the exchequer of vast sums by means of forged stamps
his offer was not however accepted
a more elaborate plot in many ways more secretly more patiently prepared than the preceding or indeed than any in the calendar
was the case of the forgeries upon the bank of england discovered in eighteen sixty three
but not before the forged paper had been put in circulation for more than a couple of years in eighteen sixty one
a man named burnett came with his wife
and took up his residence at whitchurch hampshire at no great distance from laverstock
where are measures portals mills for the manufacture of bank note paper
burnett had only just come out of jail after completing a sentence of penal servitude
his object in visiting whit church was to undermine the honesty of some workmen in the mills
and he eventually succeeded his wife making the first overtures in persuading a lad named brown to steal some of the bank paper
brown took several sheets and then was detected by brewer a fellow workman of superior grade
who threatened to betray the theft but brewer either before or after this succumbed to temptation
and stole paper on a much larger scale than brown
all that was taken was handed over to burnett or a woman in black whom brown met by appointment at waterloo station
to facilitate his operations brewer obtained a false master key from burnet
which gave him access to all parts of the mills the packing room included
in this part of the mills a large quantity of bank note paper was kept at the period of the robbery
and in the states known as water leaf and sized which are the penultimate processes of manufacture
one more remains that of glazing without which no paper is issued for engraving
none of the stolen paper was glazed and this was an important clue to the subsequent discovery of the crime
sometime in eighteen sixty two a large deficiency in the stock of bank paper unglazed was discovered at the mills
soon afterwards the inspectors of bank notes at the bank of england detected the presentation at the bank of spurious notes on genuine paper
the two facts taken in conjunction
led to the employment of the police and the offer of a reward of fifteen hundred pounds for the detection of the offenders
by this time brown alone had stolen three or four hundred sheeps
each containing two notes many of the sheets suitable for engraving any kind of note from one thousand pounds downwards
the amount of brewer's abstractions who was eventually acquitted was never exactly estimated
suspicion appears to have rested on brown who had left laverstock
and he was soon approached by the police almost directly he was questioned he made a clean breast of the whole affair
the next step was to take the principles and under such circumstances as would insure their conviction
a watch was set on burnette who was followed to the shop of one buncher a butcher in structen ground
buncher was then tracked to north kent terrace newcross where a mister and missus campbell resided
with whom he did business in exchanging the false notes
the police officers now taxed missus campbell with complicity and frightened her into collusion
with her assistance on a certain day a couple of bricks were taken out of the wall dividing her front and back parlors
the officers ensconced themselves in the latter and waited for buncher's expected visit
he came to complete a sale of forged notes and he wanted a couple of hundred pounds for what he had
missus campbell offered him less and there was an altercation in the course of which buncher became very violent and at length
after using much intemperate language he left the place in a huff
in the course of his remarks however he said
i am the man that has got all the bank paper
i have thirty thousand pounds now and the bank of england cannot stop it
this was all the police wanted to know
they next watched buncher and found that he paid frequent visits to birmingham
they also discovered that through the intermediacy of one robert comings well known as a reputed coiner
he had been introduced to a man named griffith's an engraver and copperplate printer
griffiths was an unusually clever and skilful workmen
who had devoted all his talent and all his energies for some seventeen years to the fabrication of false bank notes
on a certain day the twenty seventh october eighteen sixty two the two were arrested simultaneously
buncher in london and griffiths in birmingham
nothing was found in buncher's premises in strutton ground which were thoroughly searched
but proofs of griffith's guilt were at once apparent on entering his workroom
in one corner was a printing press actually in use and on it were twenty one forged bank of england notes without date or signature
on the bed were twenty forged ten pound notes complete and ready for use and twenty five five pound notes
mother plates for engraving the body of the notes lay about and other plates for various processes
more than this griffith strick the police to a field where in a bank a number of other plates were secreted
griffiths afterwards admitted that he had been employed in defrauding the bank since eighteen forty six
and the prominent part he played secured for him on conviction the heaviest sentence of the law
this was penal servitude for life buncher's sentence being twenty five and burnetts twenty years
cummings who had introduced buncher to griffiths
was also tried for being in possession of stolen bank paper
for improper purposes
but as there was no independent corroboration of the informer's evidence according to the custom of the british law
the case was considered not proved and he was acquitted
on his return to newgate to be finally discharged cummings jumped up the stairs and fairly danced for joy
but he was not long at large he was too active an evildoer
and was perpetually in trouble
commencing life as a resurrection man when that trade failed through the change in the law
and no more bodies were to be bought
he devoted his energies to coining and forgery and in the latter line was a friend an associate of sawords
one narrow escape he had however before he abandoned his old business
a bow street officer saw him leaving london in the evening by camberwell green accompanied by two other men
it was well known that they were resurrectionists and a strict watch was kept at all the turnpike gates on the southern roads leading into london
an officer was placed for this purpose at new cross camberwell and kennington gates
presently old bob drove up to camberwell gate in the same cart in which he had been seen to start
the officers rushed out to detain him
what have you got here
we must search the cart they cry
by all means replies bob
and a close investigation follows
without any detection of the corpse concealed
bob was therefore allowed to pass on
but they had the body all the same

it had been dressed up in decent clothes and made to stand upright in the cart
with the police officers it had passed muster
as a living member of the party
cummings was repeatedly run in for the offence of coining and uttering bad money whether coin or notes
his regular trade
followed before he took to the life of resurrectionist
was that of an engraver
he was a notorious criminal
an habitual offender in his own particular line one who would stick at no trifles to evade detection or escape capture
it is told of bob brennan
an official specially employed for years by the mint
to watch and prosecute coiners
that he received information
that coining was carried on by commings and others
at a place in westminster
he went there with a posse of officers and forced his way upstairs to the first floor
where the coiners unexpectedly disturbed fell in easy prey
but the police nearly paid the penalty of capture with their lives
proceeding cautiously down the stairs they found that the flooring at the bottom had been taken up
where it had lain was a yawning gulf or trap sufficient to do for the whole body of police
engaged in the capture
cummings was caught shortly afterwards
he was a tall slender man
with a long face and iron gray hair
the community of coiners of which he was so notorious a member
were as loll locked
the lowest among criminals except perhaps the smashers or
those who passed the counterfeit money
it was not easy to detect coiners or bring home their guilt to them
those who manufactured
and those who passed
had no direct dealings with each other
the false coin
was bought by an agent
from an agent
and dealings were carried on secretly
at the clock house in seven dials
the annals of fraudulent crime probably containd nothing
which in dramatic interest can compare with the conviction of william rupel for forgery
as the case must still be well remembered by the present generation it will be necessary to give here only the briefest summary
william repel was the eldest but illegitimate son of a wealthy man who subsequently married rupel's mother and had further legitimate issue
william was brought up as an attorney
and became in due course his father's man of business
as such
he had pretty general control over his father's estates and affairs
in eighteen fifty five
he instructed certain solicitors to prepare a deed of gift as from his father conveying to him
estates near kingston
the old gentleman's signature to this deed of gift was a forgery
but upon this forged and false conveyance william rupel who had already embarked upon a career of wild extravagance
obtained a mortgage of seven thousand pounds
in eighteen fifty six the father died
it had been supposed up to this date that he had willed his property amounting in all to upwards of two hundred thousand pounds
but after the funeral
william rupel produced another and a later will
leaving everything to the widow and constituting williams sole executor
this will
was a deliberate forgery
five or six years later
william rupel minutely described
how he had effected the fraud
the day his father died
he got the keys of his private bureau
opened it
and took out the authentic will
after reading it and finding this unfavorable to himself he resolved to carry out his deliberate plan
namely to suppress it and substitute another
he himself prepared it on a blank form which he had brought with him on purpose
to this fraudulent instrument he appended forged signatures and in due course obtained probate
as he possessed nearly unbounded influence over his mother her accession to the property meant
that william could dispose of it as he pleased
he embarked forthwith in a career of the wildest extravagance and ere long he had parted in his mother's name with most of the landed estates
one large item of his expenditure
was a contested election at lambeth
which he gained at a cost of ten thousand pounds
no fortune could stand the inroads he made into his mother's money
and in eighteen sixty two
he was obliged to fly the country hopelessly and irretrievably ruined
his disappearance gave color and substance to evil reports already in circulation that the will and conveyance above referred to
or a fictitious document

m
his next brother
who should have inherited under the authentic will
forthwith brought an ejectment on the possessor of lands purchased on the authority of the forged conveyance and will
the case was tried at guildford assizes and caused intense excitement
the hardship to the holders of these lands being plain should the allegations of invalidity be made good
the effect of establishing the forgeries would be to restore to the repel family lands for which a price had already been paid
in all good faith to another but a criminal member of the family
at first the case was contested hotly
but to the profound astonishment of everyone inside and outside the court
william ropel himself was brought as a principal witness
to clench the case
by a confession altogether against himself
he told his story with perfect coolness and self possession
but in a grave and serious tone
every word he uttered was said with consideration and sometimes with a long pause
but at the same time with an air of the most entire truthfulness and candor
he confessed himself a perjurer in having sworn to the false will and a wholesale forger
having manufactured no less than ten false signatures
to deeds involving on the whole some three hundred fifty thousand pounds
for these crimes william ropel was tried at the central criminal court on the twenty fourth september eighteen sixty two
he declined to plead
but a plea of not guilty was recorded
the case was easily and rapidly disposed of
rupel made a long statement more in exculpation than in his defence
he complained that he had at first been the dupe of others
and admitted
that he had too readily fallen astray
but while repudiating the charges made against him of systematic extravagance and immorality
he confessed that his whole life had been a gigantic mistake
and he was ready to make what atonement he could
mister justice biles in passing sentence commented severely upon the commission of such crimes by a man in rupel's position in life
and pass the heaviest sentence of the law
transportation for life
rupel received the announcement
with a cheerful countenance
and left the dock with evident satisfaction and relief at the termination of a most painful ordeal
repel was quiet and submissive while in newgate
unassuming in manner
and ready to make the best of his position
he carried this character with him into penal servitude
and after enduring the full severity of his punishment for several years
was at length advanced
to the comparative ease of a post much coveted by convicts that of hospital nurse
his uniform good conduct gained him release from portland on ticket of leave
in eighteen eighty two just twenty years after his conviction
a daring and cleverly planned robbery of diamonds was that of the tarpeaes man and wife
from an assistant of louden and riders the jewellers in bond street the trick was an old one
the assistant colled with the jewels on approbation at a house specially hired for the purpose in the west end
and was rendered insensible by chloroform after which he was bound and the precious stones stolen
missus tarpy was almost immediately captured and put on her trial but she was acquitted on the plea that she had acted under the coercion of her husband
tarpey was caught through his wife
who was followed disguised and with her hair dyed black
to a house in the merry labone road
where she met her husband
on tarpee's defence it was stated that the idea of the theft had been suggested to him by a novel at a time he had lost largely on the turf
the first plot was against mister harry emanuel
but he escaped and the attempt was made upon laudon and rider
the last great case of fraud upon the bank of england
will fitly close this branch of the criminal records of newgate
this was the well and astutely devised plot
of the brothers bid well
assisted by macdonald and noise all of them citizens of the united states by which the bank lost upwards of one hundred thousand pounds
the commercial experience of these clever rogues was cosmopolitan
their operations were no less world wide
in eighteen seventy one they crossed the atlantic
and by means of forged letters of credit and introduction from london
obtained large sums from continental banks in berlin
dresden bordeaux marseilles and leon
with this as capital they came back to england via buenos ayres
and austin bidwell opened a bonified credit in the burlington or west end branch of the bank of england
to which he was introduced by a well known tailor in savel row
after this the other conspirators travelled to obtain genuine bills and master the system of the leading houses at home and abroad
when all was ready
bidwell first refreshed his credit at the bank of england as well as disarmed suspicion
by paying in a genuine bill of measrs rothschilds for forty five hundred pounds which was duly discounted
then he explained to the bank manager
that his transactions at birmingham would shortly be very large owing to the development of his business there in the alleged manufacture of pullman cars
the ground thus cleared
the forgerss poured in from birmingham
numbers of forged acceptances
all of which
were discounted to the value of one hundred two thousand two hundred seventeen pounds
the fraud was rendered possible by the absence of a check usual in the united states
there
such bills would be sent to the drawer to be initialed
and the forgery would have been at once detected
it was the discovery of this flaw in the banking system which had encouraged the americans to attempt this crime
time was clearly an important factor in the fraud
hence the bills were sent forward in quick succession
long before they came to maturity
the forgers hoped to be well beyond arrest they had moreover sought to destroy all clue
the sums obtained by bidwell in the name of warren at the bank of england
were lodged at once by drafts to horten another alias in the continental bank
for these cash was obtained in notes
the notes were exchanged by one of the conspirators for gold at the bank of england and again the same day
a second conspirator exchanged the gold for notes but just as all promised well
the frauds were detected through the carelessness of the forgers
they had omitted to insert the dates in certain bills
the bills were sent as a matter of form to the drawer to have the date added and the forgery was at once detected
noise was seized without difficulty
as it was a part of the scheme that he should act as the dupe and remain on the spot in london until all the money was obtained
through noise the rest of the conspirators were eventually apprehended
very little if any of the ill gotten proceeds however
was ever recovered
large sums as they were realized were transmitted to the united states and invested in various american securities
where probably the money still remains
the prisoners who were committed to newgate for trial
had undoubtedly the command of large funds while there and would have readily dispersed it to effect their enlargement
a plot was soon discovered
deep laid and with many ramifications by which some of the newgate warders were to be bribed to allow the prisoners to escape from their cells at night
certain friends of the prisoners were watched and found to be in communication with these warders
to whom it was said one hundred pounds apiece had been given down as the price of their infidelity
further sums were to have been paid after the escape
and one warder admitted that he was to have one thousand pounds more paid to him and to be provided with a passage to australia
the vigilance of the newgate officials assisted by the city police completely frustrated this plot
a second was nevertheless set on foot
in which the plan of action was changed and the freedom of the prisoners was to be obtained by means of a rescue from the dock during the trial
an increase of policemen on duty sufficed to prevent any attempt of this kind
nor were these two abortive efforts all that were planned
a year or two after when the prisoners were undergoing their life sentences of penal servitude
much uneasiness was caused at one of the convict prisons by information that bribery on a large scale was again at work amongst the officials
but extra precautions and close supervision have so far proved effectual and the prisoners are still in custody after a lapse of ten years
i propose to end at this point the detailed account of the more prominent criminal cases which lodged their perpetrators in newgate
the most recent affairs are still too fresh in the public mind to need more than a passing reference
few of the newgate notorieties of late years show any marked peculiarities
their crimes follow in the lines of others already found and often more than once in the calendars
violent passions too easily aroused prompted the frenchwoman marguerite dick's blanc
to murder her mistress madame reele in park lane as crevassier the swiss had been tempted to murder lord william russell
greed in the latter case was a secondary motive
it was the principle incentive with kate webster that fierce and brutal female savage who took the life of her mistress at richmond
webster it may be mentioned here was one of the worst prisoners ever remembered in newgate
most violent in temper and addicted to the most frightful language
webster's devices for disposing of the body of her victim will call to mind those of theodore gard dell
of good and green acre and catharine hayes
greed in another form led the stountins to make away with missus patrick staunton murdering her with devilish cruelty by slow degrees
the judge sir henry hawkins in passing sentence
characterized this as a crime more black and hideous than any in the criminal annals of the country
but it was scarcely worse than that of missus brownrigg or that of the mitty yards
both of whom did their helpless apprentices to death
it was to effect the rupture of an irksome tie that led henry wainwright to murder harriet lane deliberately and in cold blood
in this case the tie was unsanctified
but it was not more inconvenient than that
which urged green acre to a similar crime
in cold blooded premeditation it rivalled that of the mannings
as in that case the grave had been dug long in anticipation and the chloride of lime purchased to destroy the corpse
henry wainwright's attempt to get rid of the body was ingenious but not original
and the circumstances which led to detection were scarcely novel proofs of the old adage that murder will out
henry wainwright's impassioned denial of his crime even after it had been brought fully home to him has many parallels in the criminal records
his disclaimer distinct and detailed on every point
was intended simply for effect
he might swear he was not the murderer that he never fired a pistol in his life
and that in spite of the verdict of the jury he left the dock with a calm and quiet conscience
but there was no doubt of his guilt as the lord chief justice told him
now
while expressing great regret
at his rash assertion
wainwright's demeanor after sentence has been described in the last chapter
doubts were long entertained whether thomas wainwright
who was convicted as an accessory after the fact had not really taken an active part in the murder
but a conversation overheard between the two brothers in newgate satisfactorily exonerated thomas wainwright
poisoning has still its victims
christina edmund's had resort to strychnia the same leeful drug that palmer used

by throwing it on a confectioner

tampered with and returned to the shop
the trial of miss edmonds was transferred to the central criminal court under lord campbell's act already referred to
she was found guilty
it will be remembered that she made a statement which led to the impanelling of a jury of matrons who decided that there was no cause for an arrest of judgment
kate webster followed the same course but these pleas of pregnancy are not common nowadays
although sentence of death was passed on edmunds
it was commuted to penal servitude for life
but she eventually passed into broad more lunatic asylum where she busies herself with water color drawing
the still more recent cases of poisoning which have occurred were not connected with newgate
the mysterious bravo case that of doctor lambson and that of kate dover
unhappily show that society is more than ever at the mercy of the insidious and unscrupulous administration of poisonous drugs
a case reproducing many of the features of the flowery land occurred twelve years later when the crew of the lenny
mutinied
murdered the captain and mates sparing the steward only on condition that he would navigate the ship to the mediterranean
the mutineers were of the same stamp as the crew of the flowery land
foreigners vindictive reckless and truculent ruffians easily moved to murderous rage
the letdies men were all greeks except one known as french peter
who was the ringleader and who had long been an habitual criminal a reputed murderer and certainly an inmate more than once of a french bun
conviction was obtained through the evidence of the steward and two of the least culpable of the crew
in newgate the leady mutineers were extremely well behaved
resolute determined looking men their courage broke down in confinement
they paid close attention to the counsels of the arcemandright and died quite penitent
a story is told of one of them big harry
the wildest and most cut throat looking of the lot which proves that he could be grateful for kindness and was not all bad
he had steadfastly refused to eat meat on some religions scruples and for the same reason would not touch soup
he was glad therefore to get an extra allowance of bread
and to show his gratitude to the warder who procured this privilege for him he made him a present
it was his own handiwork a bird pecking at a flower
the whole manufactured

the flower had berries also of bread fixed on stems made from the fibre drawn from the stuffing of his mattress

of the lesser criminals forgers thieves swindlers newgate continued to receive its full share up to the last
but there were few cases so remarkable as the great ones already recorded
mister bammle oakley made a rich harvest for a time
and was sent at the time of his trial
to have obtained as much as forty thousand pounds by false and fraudulent pretences

the chronicles of newgate volume two by arthur griffith's section twenty two newgate reformed
the time at length approached when a radical and complete change was to come over the old city jail
it was impossible for newgate to escape forever the influences pressing so strongly towards prison reform
elsewhere the spirit had been more or less active
although not uniformly or always to the same extent
there had been a pause in legislation except of a permissive kind the second and third victoria cap fifty six
laid it down that individuals might be confined separately and depart in single cells
by other acts local authorities were empowered to construct new jails or higher accommodation in the district
but no steps had been taken in parliament to enforce a better system of discipline
or to insist upon the construction of prisons on the most approved plan
as regards the first however sir james graham went home secretary in eighteen forty three
had appointed a committee of prison inspectors presided over by the under secretary of state
to draw up rules and dietaries
which were then recommended to and generally adopted by the visiting justices all over the kingdom
as regards the second
the government had set a good example and in deciding upon the erection of pentonville prison
had embarked on a considerable expenditure
in order to provide a model prison for general imitation
the first stone of pentonville prison was laid on the tenth april eighteen forty by the marquis of norman by
then home secretary and the prison which contained five hundred and twenty cells was occupied on the twenty first december eighteen forty two
this building was a costly affair
the sight was uneven and had to be levelled
moreover the gross expenditure was increased partly from its being considered necessary as it was a national prison
to make a great archway and to make the character of it more imposing than if it had been situated in the country and had been in ordinary prison
up to the twenty first december
eighteen forty two
with the additions made to that date
the total expenditure amounted to nearly ninety thousand pounds
there
about one hundred eighty pounds per sell
on the other hand
it must be admitted
that this was an experimental construction and that too strict a limitation of outlay
would have militated seriously against the usefulness of the building
nor must it be overlooked
that this the first model prison
although obtained at a considerable cost became actually what its name implied
pentonville has really been the model on which all subsequent prison construction has been based
all prisons at home and abroad are but variations
of course with the added improvements following longer experience of the pattern originated by the architectural genius
of sir joshua jim
the internal arrangements of the new model
were carefully supervised by a body of distinguished men
among which were many peers
lord john russell
mister shaw lo fever
the speaker of the house of commons sir benjamin brodie
major jib r e and the two prison inspectors messrs crawford and russell with whose names the reader is already familiar
major
afterwards sir joshua jib
was the moving spirit among these commissioners and he is now generally recognized as the originator
of modern prison architecture

the movement thus laudably initiated by the government
soon spread to the provinces
some jurisdictions greatly to their credit
strove at once to follow the lead of the central authority
within half a dozen years
no less than fifty four new prisons were built on the pentinville plan
others were in progress
and the total number of separate cells provided amounted to eleven thousand dogs
this list included
wakefield
leads
kirkdale
manchester
birmingham
and dublin
liverpool was building a new prison with a thousand cells
the county of surrey
one with seven hundred
the cost in each varied considerably
the general average being from one hundred twenty pounds to one hundred thirty pounds per scell
at kentondalle
the rate was higher
but there the expense had been increased by the sight
the difficulty of access and
the admitted necessity of giving architectural importance to this
the national model prison
other jurisdictions were less prompt to recognize their responsibilities
the city of london
among the number
as i shall presently show at length
these
were either satisfied with a makeshift
and modified existing buildings without close regard to their suitability
or for a long time did nothing at all
among the latter were notably the counties of cheshire
lincolnshire
norfook
suffolk
nottingham sure
the east and north ridings of yorkshire
the south and west of england were also very laggard

and many years were still to elapse
before the prisons in these parts were properly reconstituted
not less remarkable than this diverse interpretation of a manifest duty
was the variety of views as regards the discipline
to be introduced in these new prisons
the time was won
when thoughtful people who concerned themselves closely with social questions were greatly exercised as to the best system
of treating the inmates of a jail
a new and still imperfectly understood science had arisen
the principles of which were debated by disputants of widely opposite opinions with an earnestness that sometimes bordered upon acrimony
one school were strongly in favor
of the continuous separation of prisoners
the other supported the theory of labor in association
but under a stringent rule of silence
with isolation only at night
both systems came to us from the united states
uh
the difference was really more in degree than in principle
and our modern practice has prudently tried
to steer between the two extremes
accepting as the best system
a judicious combination of both
but about eighteen fifty
the two sides were distinctly hostile
and the controversy ran high
high authorities were in favor of continuous separation
colonel jeb preferred it
messrs crawford and witworth russell were convinced that the complete isolation of criminals from one another
was the true basis of a sound system of prison discipline
prison chaplains of experience and high repute such as measres field
clay
kingsmill bert and osborn also advocated it
it was claimed for it that it was more deterrant
that in districts where it was the rule
evildoers especially dreaded coming under its irksome conditions
another argument was
that it afforded more hope of the reformation of criminals
the system of associated labor in silence had also its warm supporters
who maintained that
under this system prisoners were more industrious and more healthy
that their condition was more natural and approximated more nearly to that of daily life
better industrial results were obtained from it
and instruction in trades was easier
and prisoners were more likely to leave jail
with the means of earning an honest livelihood if so disposed
the opposing champions were not slow to find faults and flaws in the system they condemned
separation was injurious to health
mental or physical
said one side
men broke down when subjected to it for more than a certain period
and it was unsafe to fix this limit above twelve months
although
some rash advocates were in favor of eighteen months
some indeed of two years
the other side retorted
that the system of associated labor was most costly
so many officers being required
to maintain the discipline of silence
more ozer
it was nearly impossible to prevent communication and mutual contamination
it is scarcely necessary to follow the controversy further i have only introduced the subject as showing how little as yet the state
was impressed with the necessity for authoritative interference
the legislature was content
to let local jurisdictions experimentalized for themselves
with the strange anomalous result
that a thief for other criminal
might be quite differently treated according as he was incarcerated on one side or another of a border line
this variety was often extended to all branches of prison economy
there was an absolute want of uniformity in dietaries in some prisons it was too liberal
in others too low
the amount of exercise varied from one to two hours daily to half the working day
the cells inhabited by prisoners
were of very varying dimensions
some were not sufficiently ventilated
others were warmed artificially
and were unwholesomely close
the use of gas or some other means of lighting might be adopted
but more often
was dispensed with
in a great number of prisons
no provision was made for the education of prisoners
in some others there was a sufficient staff of schoolmasters and instructors
the discipline also varied greatly
from the severely penal to the culpably lax
the greatest pains might be taken to secure isolation
the prisoners might be supervised and watched at every step and made liable to punishment for a trifling breach of an irksome code of regulations
or they might herd together or communicate freely as in the old worst days
they might see each other when they liked
and converse soto vocci
or make signs
or the chances of recognizing or being recognized were reduced to a minimum by the use of a mask
there was no general rule of employment
hard labor was often not insisted upon in separate confinement
sometimes it embraced the tread wheel
or the newly invented instruments known as cranks which ground air
the alternative between labor
or idleness
or the selection of the form of labor
were mere matters of chance and decided according to the views of the local magistracy
they were approved of and employed at some prisons at others objected to
because they were unproductive
and because the machine was often so imperfect
that the amount of effort could not be exactly regulated
opinions differed greatly with regard to the tread wheel
some authorities advocated it as a very severe and irksome punishment
which was yet under full control
and might be made to work cornmills or prove otherwise productive
other authorities as strongly condemned it as brutalizing
unequal in its operation and altogether a deplorable invention
the want of uniformity in prison discipline became ere long and acknowledged evil
pressing for some remedy
and the question was once more taken up in the house of commons
in eighteen forty nine
mister charles piearson m p
moved for a committee to report upon the best means of securing some uniform system
which should be punitive
reformatory
and self supporting
but the session was far advanced and the matter was relegated to the following year
in eighteen fifty
sir george grey brought forward a new motion to the same effect
which was promptly carried with the additional instruction to the committee to suggest any improvements
the latter had reference more especially
to a proposal emanating from mister charles pearson himself
that gentleman had come to the conclusion
that the ordinary and hackneyed methods of treatment were practically inefficacious
and that a new system of prison discipline should be introduced
his plan was to devote the whole labor of prisoners sentenced to any term between three months and four years
to agriculture
district prisons were to be established for this purpose
each of which would be in the heart of a farm of a thousand acres
the prisoners were to cultivate the land and raised sufficient produce for their own support
mister pearson backed up his recommendations by many sound arguments
field labor he urged
and with reason
was a very suitable employment
howthful
easily learnt and well adapted to the circumstances of unskilled laborers
such excellent returns might be counted upon that a margin of profit would be left after the cost of the prisons had been defrayed
the scheme was no doubt fascinating and in many respects feasible
but mister pearson overlooked some points in which a more practical mind would have foreseen difficulty and perhaps forecasted failure
in his proposal he dwelt much upon the humanizing effects of healthful open air toil
anticipating the best results from a system which made earnings and indeed reliese dependent upon the amount of work done
that industry might thus be stimulated and encouraged was probable enough
and later experience has fully proved the advantage of a judicious system of gratuities for labor
but mister pearson hardly considered the converse sufficiently and
omitted the fact that he might have to deal with that persistent idleness which is not an unknown characteristic of the criminal class
the hope of reward might do much but no system of penal discipline is complete unless it can also count upon the fear of punishment
mister pearson seems to have taken for granted that all prisoners would behave well in his district prisons
on that account he made no provision to insure safe custody
thinking perhaps that prisoners so well disposed would cheerfully remain in jail of their own accord
but an open farm of a thousand acres would have offered abundant chances of escape
which some at least would have attempted
probably with success
the creation of an expensive staff for supervision
or the still more costly process of walling in the whole farm would have greatly added to the charges of these establishments
i have lingered too long perhaps over mister pearson's proposal but some reference was indispensable to a scheme
which marked the growth of public interest in prison affairs and which was the germ of the new system
since admirably developed in the convict prisons of this country
mister pearson and the committee of eighteen fifty have the more claim on our consideration because
and the inquiry which followed attention was again attracted to newgate
the condition of that prison in eighteen fifty may be gathered from the pages of the report
not much had been done to remedy the old defects
radical improvement was generally considered impossible a great evil however had been sensibly diminished
there was no longer
or at worst but rarely and for short periods the same overcrowding
this was obviated by the frequent sessions of the central criminal court and the utilization of the two subsidiary prisons in gildsbur street and southwark
the prison population of newgate was still subject to great fluctuations but it seldom rose above two hundred and fifty or three hundred
at the most crowded periods
or just before the sessional jail delivery and at its lowest it fell sometimes to fifty or sixty
these numbers would have still further decreased and the jail would have been almost empty but for the misdemeanours who were still sent to newgate
at times on long terms of imprisonment and for the transports whom the home office were often as of old slow to remove
the old wards day rooms and sleeping rooms combined of which the reader has already heard so much
now seldom contained more than ten or a dozen each some sort of decorum was maintained among the occupants in the daytime
drinking and gaming
the indiscriminate visitation of friends and the almost unlimited admission of extra food these more glaring defects had disappeared
but reformation was only skin deep
below the surface many of the old evils still rankled
there was as yet no control over the prisoners after locking up time
this occurred in summer at eight
but in the winter months it took place at dusk and was often as early as four or five
the prisoners were still left to themselves till next morning's unlocking
and they spent some fourteen or fifteen hours in total darkness and almost without check or control
captain williams who was the inspector of prisons for the home district in succession to messrs crawford and russell
stated in evidence that he was visiting newgate one night
when he heard a great disturbance in one of the day and sleeping rooms
and on entering it found the prisoners engaged in kicking bundles of wood from one end of the ward to the other
some attempt at supervision was exercised by the night watchman stationed on the leads who might hear what went on inside
if any disturbance reached his ears he reported the case to the governor who next morning visited the ward in fault and asked for the culprit
the enforcement of discipline depended upon the want of honor among thieves
unless the guilty prisoner was given up
the whole ward was punished
either by the exclusion of visitors or the deprivation of fire
sharp tests which generally broke down the fidelity of the inmates of the ward to one another
later on a more efficacious but still imperfect method of supervision was introduced iron cages which are still to be seen in newgate
were constructed on the landings ensconced in which warders spent the night on duty and alert to watch the sleepers below
and check by remonstrance or threat of punishment all who broke the peace of the prison
these disciplinary improvements were however only slowly and gradually introduced
other changes affecting the condition and proper treatment of prisoners were not made until the inspector had urged and recommended them
thus the wards which as i have said were left in complete darkness were now to be lighted with gas
and after this most salutary eddition
the personal superintendence of knight officers as already described became possible
the rule became general as regards the prison dress hitherto clothing had been issued only to such as were destitute or in wracks and all classes of prisoners
those for trial and though sentenced for short terms or long
wore no distinguishing costume although its use was admitted not only for cleanliness but as a badge of condition and a security against escape
renewed recommendations to provide employment resulted in the provision of a certain amount of oakum for picking
and one or two men were allowed to mend clothes and make shoes
the rules made by the secretary of state were hung up in conspicuous parts of the prison
more officers were appointed as the time of so many of those already on the staff was monopolized by attendance at the central criminal court
another custom which had led to disorder was abolished
prisoners who had been acquitted were not permitted to return to the prison to show their joy and receive the congratulations of their unfortunate fellows
a corporation seems to have introduced these salutary changes without hesitation
it was less prompt apparently in dealing with structural alterations and improvements
well founded complaints had been made of the want of heating appliances in the jail
the wards had opened fires
but the separate cells were not warmed at all
a scheme for heating the whole prison with hot water pipes after the system now generally adopted elsewhere was considered
and abandoned because of the expense
as to the entire reconstruction of newgate nothing had been done as yet
this with a scheme for limiting the jail to untried prisoners had been urgently recommended by lord john russell
in eighteen thirty
his letter to the corporation under date fourth june
is an interesting document and shows that even at that date the government contemplated the erection of a model prison
lord john russell commenting upon the offer of the corporation to improve newgate
provided it was henceforth used only for untried prisoners suggested that newgate should be entirely reconstructed and the new building adopted as a model
the corporation had agreed to spend twenty thousand pounds on alterations but sixty thousand pounds would suffice to reconstruct
lord john with great fairness admitted that the whole of this burthen could not be imposed upon the city
seeing that since the establishment of the central criminal court newgate received prisoners for trial from several counties
and he was therefore prepared to submit to parliament a proposal that half the cost of reconstruction should be borne by public funds
he forwarded plans prepared by the inspectors of prisons not for blind adoption but as a guide
this plan was on the principle of cellular separation a system according to lord john russell desirable in all prisons
but in a metropolitan prison absolutely essential
the corporation in reply demurred rather to accepting strict separation as a rule
feeling that it approached too nearly to solitary confinement
the court was however prepared to consider lord john russell's proposal with regard to the cost of rebuilding
but as the plan was confessedly experimental for the benefit of the country generally the amount for which the city should be responsible should be distinctly limited
not to exceed a certain sum to be agreed upon
a provisor was also made that the magistrates should continue to exercise full control over the new jail
free from any other interference than that of the inspectors on the part of the government
no doubt wiser counsels prevailed with lord john russell
and on a more mature consideration he realized that the limited area of the existing newgate site
and the costliness of enlarging it forbade all idea of entirely reconstructing the jail so as to constitute it a model prison
it would be far better to begin at the beginning
to select a sufficiently spacious piece of ground and erect a prison which from foundations to roofs should be in conformity with the newest ideas
the preference given to the pentinville system destroyed all hopes of a complete reformation of newgate
but the condition of the great city jail was evidently considered a reproach by the city authorities and a year after the opening of the new model at pentonville
a serious effort was made to reconstruct newgate
in eighteen forty five the jail committee brought forward a definite proposal to purchase ground in the immediate vicinity for the erection of a new jail
this jail was nominally to replace the giltspur street compter
the sight of which was to be sold to christ's hospital but the intention was of course to embody and absorb old newgate in the new construction
the proposal made was to purchase some fifty thousand square feet between newgate warwick lane and the sessions house
the situation having been proved by long experience to be salubrious
but when this suggestion was brought before the court of aldermen various amendments were proposed
it was urged that the areas selected for purchase must be excessively costly to acquire and still quite inadequate for the city needs
the home secretary had laid it down that at least five acres would be indispensable and such an area it was impossible to obtain within the limits of the city
now for the first time the toughnal estate in holloway was mentioned
the corporation owned lands there covering from nineteen to twenty acres
why not move the city prison bodily into this more rural spot with its purer air and greater breathing space
eventually holloway was decided upon as a sight for the new city prison
the necessary preliminaries took some time but the contracts for the new building were completed in eighteen forty nine when the works were commenced
the prison was to contain four hundred and four prisoners and the estimated expenditure was seventy nine thousand pounds
it was to accommodate only the convicted prisoners sentenced to terms short of penal servitude and after its completion
the uses of newgate were narrowed almost entirely to those of a prison of detention
it was intended as far as possible that except awaiting trial no prisoner should find himself relegated to newgate
this principle became more and more generally the rule although it has never been punctiliously observed
now and again
misdemeanons hav found their way into newgate and within the last few years one offender against the privileges of the house of commons
with the reduction of numbers to be accommodated there was ample space in newgate for its reconstruction on the most approved modern lines
in eighteen fifty seven
the erection of a wing or large block of cells was commenced within the original walls of the prison and upon the north or mail side
this block contained one hundred and thirty cells embracing every modern improvement
it also contained eleven reception cells six punishment cells and a couple of cells for condemned criminals
this block was completed in eighteen fifty nine after which the hitherto unavoidable and long continued promiscuous association of prisoners
in eighteen sixty one a similar work was undertaken to provide separate cellular accommodation for the female in mates of newgate
and by the following year forty seven new cells had been built on the most approved plan
during this reconstruction the female prisoners were lodged in holloway
and when it was completed both sides of the prison were brought into harmony with modern ideas
the old buildings were entirely disused and the whole of the inmates of newgate were kept constantly in separate confinement
with the last re edification of newgate
a work executed some seven centuries after the first stone of the old jail was laid
the architectural records of the prison end nothing much was done at newgate in the way of building
outside our inn
after eighteen sixty two
the act for private executions led to the erection of the gallows shed in the exercising yard and at the flank of the passage from the condemned cells
the first glass house or room in which prisoners could talk in private with their attorneys but yet be seen by the warder on the watch had been constructed
and others were subsequently added
but no structural alterations were made from the date first quoted until the time of closing the prison in eighteen eighty one
but in the interval very comprehensive and i think it must be admitted salutary changes were successively introduced into the management of prisons
newgate naturally shared in any advantages due to these reforms i propose therefore to refer to them in the concluding pages of this work
and thus bring the history of prison discipline down to our own times
the last inquiry into the condition and management of our jails and houses of correction was that made by the lord's committee in eighteen sixty three
the inquiry was most searching and complete and the committee spoke plainly in its report
it animadverted strongly on the many and wide differences as regards construction labor diet and general discipline
which existed in the various prisons
leading to an inequality uncertainty and inefficiency of punishment productive of the most prejudicial results
the varieties in construction were still very marked
in many prisons the prisoners were still associated and from the want of a sufficient number of cells the principle of separation was still greatly neglected
yet this principle as the committee pointed out must now be accepted as the foundation of prison discipline
while its rigid maintenance was in its opinion vital to the efficiency of the jails
even where celvs had been built
they were frequently below the standards sids and were therefore not certified for occupation as was required by law
great numbers were not lighted at night and were without means by which their inmates could communicate in case of urgent necessity with their keepers
still greater were the differences with regard to employment
the various authorities held widely different opinions as to what constituted hard labour
here the tread wheel was in use
there cellular cranks or hard labour machines
both however varied greatly in mechanism and in the amount of energy they called forth
while the former was intended for the congregate labor of a number
and the latter as its name implies imposed continuous solitary toil
at other prisons shot drill the lifting and carrying of heavy round shot was the favorite method of inflicting penal labor
with these differences were others as opposed concerning industrial occupation
the jail authorities often gave the highest possibly undue importance to the value of remunerative employment
and sought to make profitable returns from prisoners labor the test of prison efficiency in this view the committee could not coincide
and it was decidedly of opinion that in all short sentences the hard labour of the tread wheel crank and so forth should be the invariable rule
in dietaries again the same wide diversity of practice obtained
the efforts made by sir james graham years before to introduce uniformity in this particular had failed of effect
the secretary of states suggested scale of diet had seldom been closely followed
in some places the dietary was too full
in others too meagre
its constituents were not of the most suitable character
more animal food was given than was necessary
vegetables especially the potato that most valuable anti scorbutic was too often omitted
in a word the value of diet as a part of penal discipline
was still insufficiently recognized
the prisons were still far from inflicting the three punishments hard labor hard fair and a hard bed
which sir joshua jeb told the committee he considered the proper elements of penal discipline
it is interesting to note here
that the committee of eighteen sixty three fully indorsed sir joshua's recommendations as regards a hard bed and recommended that
during short sentences or the earlier stages of a long confinement
the prisoners should be made to dispense with the use of a mattress and should sleep on planks
this suggestion was adopted in the act of eighteen sixty five which followed the committee's report and of which more directly
laws ninety two schedule one of that act authorized the use of plank beds which were adopted in many prisons
they are now the universal rule
introduced as was erroneously supposed by the prison commissioners appointed under the prison act of eighteen seventy seven
their origin it will be seen dates back much further than that
beds might well be made hard
and their use strictly limited
according to this committee of eighteen sixty three beds in the smaller and most carelessly conducted prisons formed a large element in the life of a prisoner
in one jail fifteen hours were spent in bed out of the twenty four this was in keeping with other grave defects and emissions
the minor borough prisons were the worst blot on the still darkened imperfect system
they were very numerous very imperfect in construction and management and they were very little required
in them according to the committee the old objectionable practices were still in full force
there was unrestrained association of untried and convicted juvenile with adult prisoners vagrants misdemeanours felons
there were dormitories without light control or regulation at night
which warders dreading assault were afraid to enter after dark even to check rioting and disturbance
prisoners still slept to in a bed
in one prison the bedsteads had been removed lest the prisoners should break them up and convert them into weapons of offence
the prison buildings were in many places out of repair
other houses often overlooked them
a single officer was the only custodian and disciplinary authority in the jail
complete idleness was tolerated there was neither penal labor nor light employment
the prisoners intercommunicated freely and exercised the most injurious corrupting influences upon one another
a total want of administration was very marked
but in one prison it was such that the prisoner's food was supplied daily from the neighbouring inn and the innkeeper's bill constituted the only accounts kept
the committee might well suggest the abolition of these jails or their amalgamation with a larger county establishments in their immediate neighbourhood
some idea of the comparative uselessness of these small borough prisons was conveyed by some figures quoted by the committee
in eighteen sixty two there were in all one hundred and ninety three jails in england and wales
of these sixty three gave admittance during the entire year to less than twenty five prisoners
twenty two others received between eleven and twenty five
fourteen received less than eleven and more than six
while twenty seven received less than six prisoners and were in some instances absolutely tenantless
the result of the recommendation of the committee of eighteen sixty two was the prison act of eighteen sixty five
the penultimate of such enactments many of the provisions of which still remain in force
the main object of this act was to compass that uniformity in discipline and treatment generally
which had long been admitted as indispensable
and had never as yet been properly obtained
the legislature was beginning to overcome its disinclination to interfere actively or authoritatively
with the local jurisdictions although still very leniently disposed
however it now laid down in plain language and with precise details the requirements of a good jail system
the separation of prisoners and cells duly certified by the inspectors was insisted upon
also their constant employment an labor appropriate to their condition
hard labor of the first and second class was carefully defined
the former which consisted principally of the tread wheel cranks capstans shot drill
was to be the rule for all convicted prisoners throughout the early stages of their detention
while the latter which included various forms of industrial employment
was the boon to which willing industry extending over a long period
established a certain claim
the infliction of punishment more or less uniform was thus aimed at
on the other hand new and careful regulations were framed to secure the moral and material well being of the inmates of the jails
the law made it imperative that every prison should have a prisond chapel and that daily and sundays services should be held
the chaplain's duties were enlarged and the principle of toleration accepted to the extent of securing to all prisoners
the ministrations of ministers of their own form of belief
steps were taken to provide the illiterate with secular instruction
no less close was the care as regards preservation of health
stringent rules were prescribed for the prison surgeons
every prison was ordered to keep up an infirmary and the medical supervision was to be strict and continuous
dietaries were drawn up for adoption on the recommendation of a committee of experts
baths were provided ablutions ordered and all appliances to insure personal cleanliness
the administration of good government was to be watched over by the local magistracy certain of whom styled visiting justices
were elected to inspect the prisons frequently to examine the prisoners here complaints and check abuses
under them the governor or jailer was held strictly responsible
the books and journals he was to keep were minutely specified and his constant presence in or near the jail was insisted upon
his disciplinary powers were defined by the act and his duties
both in controlling his subordinates and in protecting the prisoners from petty tyranny and doppression every one of whom he was to see once every twenty four hours
but discipline was to be maintained if necessary by punishment
while decency and good order were to be insured by the strict prohibition of gambling and drunkenness
the latter was rendered nearly impossible by the penalties imposed on persons bringing spirituous liquors into the jail
the old custom so fruitful of the worst evils of keeping a tap inside the prison was made illegal
so was the employment of prisoners in any position of trust or authority
they were not to be turnkeys or assistant turnkeys neither wardsman nor yardsmen overseer
monitor or schoolmaster nor to be engaged in the service of any officer of the prison
the act of eighteen sixty five also encouraged and empowered the local authorities to alter en large or rebuild their prisons
they might raise funds for this purpose provided a certificate for the necessity for the new works was given either by the recorder
chairmen of quarter sessions or even by a couple of justices
every facility was promised the sanction of the secretary of state would not be withheld if plans and estimates were duly submitted
and they met with the approval of his professional adviser the surveyor general of prisons
the funds necessary would be advanced by the public works lone commissioners and the interest might be charged against the county or borough raits
nor were these the only inducements offered where local authorities were indisposed to set their prisons in order
or hesitated to embark upon any considerable expenditure to alter or rebuild
they were at liberty to hire suitable cell accommodation from any neighbors who might have it to spare the only proviso
that no such contract was valid between one jurisdiction and another unless the secretary of state was satisfied that the prisonet was intended to use
came up in all respects to modern requirements
but the act was not limited to permissive legislation its provisions and enactments were backed up by certain penalties
the secretary of state was empowered to deal rather summarily with inadequate prisons in other words
with those in which there was no separation no proper enforcement of hard labor no chapel infirmary and so forth
he could in the first place withhold the government grant in aid of prisoned funds by refusing this certificate to the treasury upon which the allowance was paid
this he might do on the representation of the inspector of prisons
who was bound to report any deficiencies and abuses he might find at his periodical visits the secretary of state might go further
where the local authority had neglected to comply with the provisions of the eighteen sixty five act for four consecutive years
he could close the inadequate prison by declaring it unfit for the reception of prisoners
his order would at the same time specify some neighbouring and more satisfactory prison which the local authority would be compelled to utilize instead
and with the concurrence of the other authority and on payment
a few provisos governed these rather extensive powers
it was necessary for instance to give due notice when the government grant was to be withdrawn
and with the warning a copy of the particular defects and allegations was to be sent to the local authority
the latter too was to be laid before the house of commons
in the same way six months notice was required in cases where the closing of a prison was contemplated
but if these conditions were observed the secretary of state could deal sharply enough with the defaulting jurisdictions
yet the law was seldom if ever enforced
it was practically inoperative as regards the penalties for neglect it was no doubt as irksome and inconvenient to the secretary of state
to avail himself of his powers as it was difficult to bring home the derelictions of duties and devasion of the acts too much was left to the inspectors
it was nearly impossible for them to exercise a very close supervision over the whole of the prisons of the country
there were only two of them and they could not visit each prison more than once in each year sometimes not oftener than once in eighteen months
the task imposed upon them tending as it did to the imposition of a fine upon the local authorities was not a pleasant one
and it is not strange if they did not very frequently hand up the offenders to the reproof and correction of the secretary of state
as the almost inevitable consequence while the more glaring defects imprison management disappeared
matters went on after the eighteen sixty five act much the same as they had done before districts differed greatly in the attention they paid to prison affairs
in one part the most praiseworthy activity prevailed
in another there was half heartedness even apathy and an almost complete contempt for the provisions of the act
as the years passed great want of uniformity continued to prevail throughout the prisons of the united kingdom
the whole question assumed sufficient importance to become a part of the government programme when lord beaconsfield took office in eighteen seventy four
the home secretary in that administration
mister now sir richard cross having applied himself vigorously to the task of reorganizing the whole system became convinced
that no complete reform could be accomplished so long as the prisons were left under the jurisdiction of the local authorities
the prison's bill of eighteen seventy six contemplated the transfer of the prisons to government
this bill reintroduced in eighteen seventy seven became law that year
after which the whole of the prisons including newgate
passed under the more direct control of the state
since then a strong central authority has labored steadfastly to compass concentration
to close useless prisons and to ensure that uniformity of system which all thoughtful persons have long admitted to be of paramount importance
in the administration of prisons
three years after the advent of the prison commissioners it was decided that newgate was an excessively costly and redundant establishment
it was only filled at the periods when the sessions of the central criminal court were in progress
at others an expensive staff was maintained with little or nothing to do
at a short distance stood another prison of detention that of clerkenwell
with spare accommodation sufficient to receive all prisoners who were then committed to newgate these arguments were unanswerable
accordingly it was ordered by sir william harcourt the present secretary of state that newgate should cease to be used as a regular prison
and it is now except during sessions or when the gallows is in requisition practically and forever closed
marian harland's cookery for beginners bread sponge and breakfast breads
bread raised with what is known to bakers as a sponge
requires more time and a trifle more work
than the simpler form for which i have just already given directions
but it keeps fresh longer
is softer and more nutritious and a second rate brand of flower thus treated
produces a better loaf
than when mixed up with yeast and water only
sponge making is therefore an important if not an essential accomplishment in a cook be she novice or veteran
three potatoes of fair size peeled and boiled mealy
five tablespoonfuls of yeast
one tablespoonful of white sugar
one tablespoonful of butter
three cups of lukewarm water in which the potatoes were boiled strained through a coarse cloth
one heaping cup of sifted flour
put the potatoes into a large bowl or tray
and mash them to powder with a potato beetle
or a wooden spoon
while still hot mix in the sugar and butter beating all to a lumpless cream
add a few spoonfuls at a time the potato water alternately with the flower by the handful
beating the batter smooth as you go on until all of the liquid in flower has gone in
beat hard one minute before pouring in the yeast
it is well to stir into the east a bit of soda no larger than a grain of corn already wet up in a tea spoonful of boiling water
now wip up the batter with a wooden spoon for another minute and the sponge is made
throw a cloth over the bowl
and set by for five or six hours to rise
if you intend to bake in the forenoon make the sponge at bedtime if in the afternoon early in the morning
when the sponge is light sift a quart and a cup of flour into a bowl or tray with two teaspoonfuls of salt
into a hollow like a crater in the middle of the flower
empty your sponge bow and work the flour down into it
wash out the bowl with a little lukewarm water and add this to the dough
if it should prove too soft work in cautiously a little more flour
if two stiff warm water a spoonful at a time until you can handle the paste easily the danger is in getting it too stiff
now
knead and set for risings first and second as you have already been instructed this sponge will be found especially useful in making gray and bread
one quart of grayam flour one cup of white flour
one half cup of indian meal
one half cup of molasses two teaspoonfuls of salt soda the size of a pea
half the quantity of sponge given in preceding receipt
warm water for rinsing bull about half a cup
put the brown or graham flower unsifted into the bread boll
sift into it white flour meal and salt and stir up well while dry
into the crater dug out in the middle pour the sponge warm water the molasses and soda dissolved in hot water
knead as you would white bread and set aside for the rising
it will not swell so fast as the white so give yourself more time for making it
when light
need well and long
make into two loaves then put into well greased pans and leave for an hour or until it becomes more than twice the original size of the dough
take care that it does not burn in baking the molasses renders it liable to scorching
the oven must be steady but not so hot as for white bread
nor will the grayamd bread be done quite so soon as that made of bolted flour
turnd the pans once while baking moving them as gently as possible
if rudely shaken or jarred there will be heavy streaks in loaves
graham bread is wholesome and sweet and ought to be eaten frequently in every family particularly by young people whose bones and teeth are in forming
the phosphates which the process of bolting removes to a large extent from white flour go directly to the manufacture of bone
and these also tend to nourish and strengthen the brain
after mixing your bread in the morning either with sponge or with the yeast divine the kneeded dough into two portions
mould one into a round ball and set aside for a loaf as already directed
make a hole in the middle of the other batch and pour into it a table spoonful of butter just melted but not hot
close the dough over it dust your hands a kneading board with flour and work in the shortening until the dough is elastic and ceases to be sticky
put it into a flowered bowl
cover with a cloth and set away out of draft and undue heat for three hours
need it again then and wait upon its rising for another three hours the dough should be as soft as it can be handled
when it is light for the second time flower your board rubbing in the flour and blowing lightly away what does not adhere to the surface
tosse the lump dough upon it and knead thoroughly for five minutes
flour a rolling pin and roll the dough into a sheet not more than half an inch thick
cut this into round cakes with a biscuit cutter or a sharp edged tumbler and fold not quite in the middle
in the form of turnovers pinching the corners of the fold pretty hard
to hinder the flap of dough from flying up as the rising proceeds
rub the bottom and sides of a baking pan with sweet lard or butter
do this
with a bit of clean soft rag or tissue paper
visiting every corner of the pan but not leaving thick layers and streaks of grease after it
arrange the rolls in regular rows in the pan about a quarter of an inch apart
cover with a cloth and set nearer the fire than you dared trust at the dough and let them rise for an hour
peep under the cloth two or three times to see whether they rise evenly and turn the pan around once that all may be equally exposed to the heat
when the time is up and the rolls are puffy and promising set them in a pretty quick oven and bake half an hour
turning the pan once in this time and covering with clean never printed paper should they brown too fast
break the rolls apart from one another and eat warm they are also good cold and if the directions be followed implicitly
very good always
gram rolls are made by treating the dough mixed for gray and bread as above and following the foregoing receipt in every section but allowing more time for rising and baking
they are even better when cold than hot
breakfast biscuit
two cups of fresh milk slightly warmed
one quart and a cup of flour sifted
five tablespoonfuls of the east
one even tablespoonful of white sugar
one even teaspoonful of salt
bit of soda as large as a pea dissolved in hot water
one tablespoonful of butter just melted not hot
yoke of one egg beaten light
sift the flour salt and sugar into a bowl
hollo the heap
in the centre and pour in the milk
working down the flour into the liquid with a spoon o'r your hands until it is thoroughly melted
into a second hollow
for the east and knead thoroughly for fifteen minutes
rap bowl and biscuit in thick cloth and set to rise where it will neither become chilled nor sour overnight
studied the temperature in different parts of the kitchen and kitchen closets to the end of finding the best places for raising doe and sponge
do all this at bedtime
early in the morning turn out the dough upon a flowered board work it for a minute into manageable shape
drill several finger holes in it and fill them with the melted butter
the dissolved soda
and the beaten yolk of egg
pinched the dough hard to stop the mouths of these cavities
and need for ten minutes carefully at first lest the liquids should be wasted and more boldly when they are absorbed by the paste
roll out into a sheet half an inch thick
with a flowered rolling pin
cut into round cakes
set these closely together in a well greased pan
prick each with a fork and let them rise near the fire for half an hour covered with a light cloth
bake from twenty to twenty five minutes in a quick oven
turning the pan around once quickly and lightly
break apart from one another and pile on a plate
throwing a clean doily or a small napkin over them
break open at table
hot rolls and muffins should never be cut
one word with regard to getting up early in order to give dee a chance for the second rising
it is not a wholesome practice for any woman
least of all a young girl
to be out of bed two hours before she eats her breakfast
studying upon an empty stomach provokes dyspepsia and injures the eyes
active exercise an like circumstances tempts stebility and disease
yet our bread and rolls must be looked after at the proper time
have yourself called on biscuit mornings an hour earlier than usual
rise wash face and hands rinsed the mouth out and brush back the hair
put on stockings and slippers such underclothing as may be needed to prevent gold a wrapper and the kitchen apron
cover your hair entirely with a handkerchief or sweeping cap
before beginning operations downstairs
eat a half slice of dry bread or a biscuit
you will not relish it but take it all the same to appease the empty discontented stomach
having made out your rolls and tucked them up snugly for the final rise return to your chamber for a comfortable bath and toilet
when habited for the day and all except the outer gown collar et cetera slip on the wrapper again
and run down to put the biscuits in the oven
unless it is too hot they will get no harm while you finished dressing in ten minutes just in season to turn the pan
from the beginning of your apprenticeship in housewifery learn how to dovetail your duties neatly into one another
a wise accommodation of parts and angles and compactness in the adjustment of must be dones
are better than mere personal strength in the accomplishment of such tasks as full to women to perform
master these and do not let them master you
weave the little duties in and under and among what seemed to be the greater
while your bread is taking a three hours arise
you are free in body and mind for other things
the grand secret of keeping house well and without worry
lies in the art of packing and fitting different kinds of work
and in picking up the minutes
other things besides rising do get on quite as well without your standing by to watch them
the fireside checks of franklin delinol roosevelt by franklin d roosevelt
section six
september thirtith nineteen thirty four
three months have passed since i talked with you shortly after the adjournment of the congress
to night
i continue that report though because of the shortness of time i must defer a number of subjects to a later date
recently
the most notable public questions that have concerned us all
have had to do with industry and labor
and with respect to these
certain developments have taken place which i consider of importance
i am happy to report
that after years of uncertainty
culminating in the collapse of the spring of nineteen thirty three
we are bringing order
out of the old chaos
with a greater certainty of the employment of labor at a reasonable wage
and of more business at a fair prophet
these governmental and industrial developments hold promise of new achievements for the nation
men may differ as to the particular form of governmental activity
with respect to industry and business
but nearly all are agreed
that private enterprise in times such as these
but also our processes of civilization
the underlying necessity for such activity
is indeed a strong now as it was years ago when elihu root said the following very significant words
instead of the give and take
of free individual contract
the tremendous power of organization has combined great aggregations of capital in enormous industrial establishments
working through vast agencies of commerce and employing great masses of men in movements of production
and transportation and trade so great in the mass that each individual concerned in them
is quite helpless by himself
the relations between the employer and the employed
between the owners of aggregated capital
and the units of organized labor
between the small producer the small trader
the consumer
and the great transporting and manufacturing and distributing agencies
all present new questions for the solution of which the old reliance upon the free action of individual wills appears quite inadequate
and in many directions
the intervention of that organized control
which we call government
seems necessary to produce the same result of justice and right conduct
which obtained through the attrition of individuals before the new conditions arose
it was in this spirit thus described by secretary route
that we approached our task of reviving private enterprise in march nineteen thirty three
our first problem was of course the banking situation because
as you know the banks had collapsed
some banks could not be saved
but
the great majority of them
either through their own resources or with government aid
have been restored to complete public confidence
this has given safety to millions of depositors in these banks
closely following this great constructive effort
we have through various federal agencies
saved debtors and creditors alike
in many other fields of enterprise
such as loans on farm mortgages
and home mortgages
loans to the railroads and insurance companies
and finally
help for home owners
and industry itself
in all of these efforts
the government
has come to the assistance of business
and with the full expectation that the money used
to assist these enterprises will eventually be repaid
i believe it will be
the second step we have taken in the restoration of normal business enterprise
has been to clean up thoroughly unwholesome conditions
in the field of investment
in this
we have had assistance from many bankers and business men
most of whom recognized the past evils in the banking system
in the sale of securities
in the deliberate encouragement of stock gambling
in the sale of unsound mortgages
and in many other ways in which the public
lost
billions of dollars
they saw
but without changes in the policies and methods of investment
there could be no recovery of public confidence
in the security of savings
the country now enjoys the safety
of bank savings
under the new banking laws
the careful checking of new securities under the securities act
and the curtailment
of rank stock speculation
through the securities exchanger
i sincerely hope
that as a result
people will be discouraged and unhappy efforts to get rich quick
by speculating
insecurities
the average person
almost always loses
only a very small minority of the people of this country believe in gambling as a substitute
for the old philosophy of benjamin franklin
that the way to wealth
is through work
in meeting the problems of industrial recovery
the chief agency of the government
has been the national recovery administration
under its guidance
trades and industries covering over ninety per cent of all industrial employees
have adopted codes
of fair competition
which have been approved by the president
under these codes
in the industries covered
child labor has been eliminated
the workday
and the work week have been shortened
minimum wages have been established
and other wages adjusted
toward a rising standard of living
the emergency purpose of the n r a
was to put men to work
and since its creation more than four million persons have been re employed
in great part
through the co operation of american business
brought about under the codes
benefits of the industrial recovery programme have come
not only to labor in the form of new jobs
in relief from overwork
and in relief from under pay
but also to the owners and managers of industry because
together with a great increase in the pay rolls
there has come a substantial rise in the total of industrial profits
arise
from a deficit figure in the first quarter of nineteen thirty three
to a level of sustained prophets
within one year
from the inauguration of n r a
now
it should not be expected that
even employed labor and capital would be completely satisfied with present conditions
employed workers
have not by any means all enjoyed a return to the earnings of prosperous times
otho
millions of hitherto under privileged workers are to day
far better paid
than ever before
also
billions of dollars of invested capital have to day
a greater security of present and future earning power than before
this is because of the establishment of fair
competitive standards
and because of relief from unfair competition
in wage cutting
which depresses markets
and destroys purchasing power
but
it is an undeniable fact
that the restoration of other billions of sound investments
to a reasonable earning power
could not be brought about
in one year
there is no magic formula
no economic panacea
which could simply revive overnight
the heavy industries and the trades dependent upon them
nevertheless
the gains of trade and industry as a whole
have been substantial
in these games and
in the policies of the administration
there are assurances that hearken
all forward looking men and women
with the confidence
that we are definitely rebuilding our political and economic system on the lines laid down by the new deal
lines which
as i have so often made clear
are in complete accord
with the underlying principles of
orderly
popular government
which americans have demanded
since the white man first came to these shores
we count
in the future as in the past
on the driving power of individual initiative
and
the incentive of fair private prophet
strengthened with the acceptance of those obligations to the public interest
which rests upon us all
we have the right
to expect
that this driving power
will be given patriotically
and wholeheartedly
to our nation
we have passed through the formative period of code making
in the national recovery administration
and half effected a reorganization of the n r a
suited to the needs of the next phase
which is in turn
a period of preparation for legislation
which will determine its permanent form
in this recent reorganization
we have recognized three distinct
functions
first
the legislative or policy making function
second
the administrative function of code making and revision
and third
ejudicial function
which includes enforcement
consumer complaints
and the settlement of disputes between employers and employees
and between one employer and another
we are now prepared to move into this second phase
on the basis of our experience in the first phase
under the able
and energetic leadership of general johnson
we shall watch carefully
the working of this new machinery for the second phase of n r a
modifying it
where it needs modification
and finally making recommendations to the congress
in order that
the functions of n r a which have proved there worth
may be made a part of the permanent machinery of government
let me call your attention to the fact
that the national industrial recovery act
gave business men the opportunity they had sought for years to improve business conditions

through what has been called self government and industry
if the codes which have been written
have been too complicated
if they have gone too far in such matters as price fixing and
limitation of production
let it be remembered
that so far as possible
consistent
with the immediate public interest of this past year
and the vital necessity of improving labor conditions
the representatives of trade and industry
were permitted to write their ideas into the codes
it is now time to review these actions as a whole
to determine through deliberative means in the light of experience
from the standpoint of the good of the industries themselves
as well as the general public interest
whether the methods and policies adopted in the emergency
have been best calculated
to promote industrial recovery
and a permanent improvement of business and labor conditions
there may be a serious question
as to the wisdom of many of those devices to control production
or to prevent destructive price cutting
which many business organizations have insisted were necessary
here
whether their effect may have been to prevent that volume of production
which would make possible lower prices
and increased employment
another question arises
as to whether in fixing minimum wages on the basis of an hourly or weekly wage
we have reached into the heart of the problem
which is to provide such annual earnings for the lowest paid worker
as will meet his vinomum needs
we also questioned the wisdom
of extending code requirements suited
to the great industrial centres and to large employers
to the great number of small employers
in the smaller communities
during the last twelve months
our industrial recovery has been to some extent
retarded by strikes
including a few of major importance
i would not minimize the inevitable losses to employers and employees
and to the general public through such conflicts
but
i would point out
that the extent and severity of labor disputes during this period
has been far less than in any previous comparable period
when the business men of the country were demanding the right
to organize themselves adequately to promote their legitimate
interests
when the farmers were demanding legislation
which would give them opportunities and incentives to organize themselves for a common advance
it was natural
that the workers should seek
and obtain a statutory declaration
of their constitutional right
to organize themselves
for collective bargaining as embodied in section seven a
of the national industrial recovery act
machinery set up by the federal government
has provided some new methods of adjustment
both employers
and employees must share the blame
of not using them as fully as they should
the employer who turns away from impartial agencies of peace
who denies freedom of organization to his employees
air
fails to make every reasonable effort
at a peaceful solution of their differences
is not fully supporting the recovery effort
of his government
the workers who turn away from these same impartial agencies
and decline to use their good offices to gain their ends
are likewise not fully co operating with their government
it is time
that we made a clean cut effort
to bring about that united action of management and labor
which is one of the high purposes of the recovery act
we have passed through more than a year of education
step by step
we have created all the government agencies necessary
to insure as a general rule
industrial peace
with justice for all those willing to use these agencies
whenever their voluntary bargaining fails to produce a necessary agreement
there should be at least a full and fair trial
given to these means of ending industrial warfare
and
in such an effort
we should be able to secure for employers and employees
and consumers
the benefits that all derive
from the continuous
peaceful operation of our essential enterprises
accordingly
i propose to confer
within the coming month
with small groups of those truly representative of large employers of labor
and of large groups of organized labor
in order to seek their co operation
in establishing what i may describe
as a specific trial period of industrial peace
from those willing to join in establishing this hoped for period of peace
i shall seek assurances of the making
and maintenance of agreements
which can be mutually relied upon
under which
wages
hours and working conditions
may be determined
and
any later adjustments shall be made either by agreement
or in case of disagreement
through the mediation or arbitration
of state or federal agencies
i shall not ask either employers or employees permanently
to lay aside the weapons common to industrial war
at
i shall ask both groups
to give a fair trial
tw
peaceful methods of adjusting their conflicts of opinion and interest
and to experiment for a reasonable time
with measures suitable
to civilize
our industrial
civilization
closely alihed to the n r a
is the programme of public works
provided for in the same act
and designed to put more men back to work
both directly on the public works themselves
and indirectly
in the industries supplying the materials for these public works
to those who say that
our expenditures for public works and other means for recovery
are a waste that we cannot afford
i answer it
no country
however rich
can afford the waste of its human resources
demoralization caused by vast unemployment
is our greatest extravagance
morally
it is the greatest menace to our social order
some people try to tell me
that we must make up our minds
that for the future
we shall permanently have millions of unemployed
just as other countries have had them for over a decade
what may be necessary for those countries
is not my responsibility to determine
what
as for this country
i stand or fall by my refusal to accept as a necessary condition of our future
a permanent army of unemployed
on the contrary
we must make it a national principle
that we will not tolerate a large army of unemployed
and that we will arrange our national economy
to end our present on employment
as soon as we can
and then
to take wise measures against its return
i do not want to think
that it is the destiny of any american
to remain permanently
on relief rolls
nose
fortunately few in number
who are frightened by boldness and cowed by the necessity for making decisions
complaind
that all we have done is unnecessary
and subject
two great risks
now that these people are coming out of their storm cellars
they forget
that there ever was a storm
they point to england
they would have you believe that england has made progress out of her depression
by a duw nothing policy
by letting nature take her course
england has her peculiarities
and we have ours
but i do not believe any intelligent observer
can accuse england of undue orthodoxy
in the present emergency
did england let nature take our course
no
did england hold to the gold standard when her reserves were threatened
has england gone back to the gold standard to day
did england hesitate
call in ten billion dollars of her war bonds
bearing five per cent interest
to issue new bonds therefore bearing only three and one half per cent interest
thereby saving the british treasury
one hundred and fifty million dollars a year
in interest alone
and
let it be recorded
that the british bankers
helped
is it not a fact
that ever since the year nineteen o nine
great britain
in many ways has advanced further along lines of social security
than the united states
is it not a fact
that relations between capital and labor
on the basis of collective bargaining
are much further advanced in great britain
than in the united states
it is perhaps not strange
that the conservative british press
has told us with
pardonable irony
that much of our new deal programme
is only an attempt to catch up with english reforms
that go back ten years or more
nearly all americans are sensible and calm people
we do not get greatly excited
nor is our peace of mind disturbed
whether we be business men or workers or farmers
by awesome pronouncements concerning the unconstitutionality
of some of our measures of recovery and relief and reform
we are not frightened by reactionary lawyers
or political editors
all of these cries have been heard before
more than twenty years ago
when theodore roosevelt and woodrow wilson
were attempting to correct abuses in our national life
the great
chief justice white said
there is great danger seems to me
to arise from the constant habit
which prevails
where anything is opposed
or objected to
of referring without rhyme or reason to the constitution
as a means of preventing its accomplishment
thus creating the general impression
that the constitution is but a barrier to progress
instead of being the broad highway
through which alone true progress
may be enjoyed
in our efforts for recovery
we have avoided on the one hand
the theory that business should
and must be taken over
into an all embracing government
we have avoided on the other hand
the equally untenable theory
that it is an interference with liberty to offer reasonable help
when private enterprise
is in need of help
the course we have followed
fits the american practice of government
a practice of taking action step by step
of regulating only to meet concrete needs
a practice of courageous recognition of change
i believe with abraham lincoln
tat
the legitimate object of government
is to do for a community of people
whatever they need to have done
but cannot do at all
or cannot do so well for themselves
in their separate
and individual capacities
i am not for a return to that definition of liberty
under which for many years
a free people
were being gradually regimented
into the service of the privileged few
i prefer
and i am sure you prefer
that broader definition of liberty
under which we are moving forward to greater freedom
to greater security for the average man
than he has ever known before
in the history
as america
the fireside chets of franklin delino roosevelt by franklin d roosevelt section seven
april twenty eighth nineteen thirty five
since my annual message to the congress on january fourth last
i have not addressed the general public over the air
in the many weeks since that time
the congress has devoted itself to the arduous task of formulating legislation necessary to the country's welfare
it has made and is making distinct progress
before i come to any of the specific measures however
i want to leave in your minds one clear fact
the administration and the congress are not proceeding in any haphazard fashion in this task of government
each of our steps has a definite relationship to every other step
the job of creating a programme for the nation's welfare is in some respects like the building of a ship
at different points on the coast where i often visit they build great sea going ships
when one of these ships is under construction and the steel frames have been set in the keel
it is difficult for a person who does not know ships to tell how it will finally look when it is sailing the high seas
it may seem confused to some
but out of the multitude of detailed parts that go into the making of the structure
the creation of a useful instrument for man ultimately comes
it is that way with the making of a national policy
the objective of the nation has greatly changed in three years
before that time
individual self interest and group selfishness or paramount in public thinking
the general good was at a discount
three years of hard thinking have changed the picture
more and more people
cause of clearer thinking and a better understanding
are considering the whole rather than a mere part relating to one section or to one crop
or to one industry or to an individual private occupation
that is a tremendous gain for the principles of democracy
the overwhelming majority of people in this country know how to sift the wheat from the chaff in what they hear and what they read
they know that the process of the constructive rebuilding of america cannot be done in a day or a year
but that it is being done in spite of the few who seek to confuse them and to profit by their confusion
americans as a whole are feeling a lot better a lot more cheerful than for many many years
the most difficult place in the world to get a clear open perspective of the country as a whole is washington
i am reminded sometimes of what president wilson once said
so many people come to washington who know things that are not so
and so few people who know anything about what the people of the united states are thinking about
that is why i occasionally leave this scene of action for a few days
to go fishing or back home to hyde park
so that i can have a chance to think quietly about the country as a whole
to get away from the trees as they say and to look at the whole forest
this duty of seeing the country in a long range perspective
is one which in a very special manner attaches to this office to which you have chosen me
did you ever stop to think that there are after all only two positions in the nation
that are filled by the vote of all the voters the president and the vice president
that makes it particularly necessary for the vice president and for me to conceive of our duty toward the entire country
i speak therefore to night
two and of the american people as a whole
my most immediate concern is in carrying out the purposes of the great work programme just enacted by the congress
its first objective is to put men and women now on the relief rolls to work and incidentally
to assist materially in our already unmistakable march toward recovery
i shall not confuse my discussion by a multitude of figures so many figures are quoted to prove so many things
sometimes it depends upon what paper you read and what broadcast you hear
therefore let us keep our minds on two or three simple essential facts in connection with this problem of unemployment
it is true that while business and industry are definitely better
our relief rolls are still too large
however for the first time in five years the relief rolls have declined instead of increased during the winter months
they are still declining
the simple fact is that many million more people have private work to day than two years ago to day or one year ago to day
and every day that passes offers more chances to work for those who want to work
in spite of the fact that unemployment remains a serious problem
here as in every other nation we have come to recognize the possibility and the necessity of certain helpful remedial measures
these measures are of two kinds
the first is to make provisions intended to relieve to minimise and to prevent future on employment
the second is to establish the practical means to help those who are unemployed in this present emergency
our social security legislation is an attempt to answer the first of these questions
our work's relief programme the second
the programme for social security now pending before the congress is a necessary part of the future unemployment policy of the government
while our present and projected expenditures for work relief are wholly within the reasonable limits of our national credit resources
it is obvious that we cannot continue to create governmental deficits for that purpose year after year
we must begin now to make provision for the future
that is why our social security programme is an important part of the complete picture
it proposes by means of old age pensions
to help those who have reached the age of retirement
to give up their jobs and thus give to the younger generation greater opportunities for work
and to give to all a feeling of security as they looke toward old age
the unemployment insurance part of the legislation
will not only help to guard the individual in future periods of lay off against dependence upon relief
but it will by sustaining purchasing power cushioned the shock of economic distress
another helpful feature of unemployment insurance is the incentive it will give to employers to plan more carefully
in order that unemployment may be prevented by the stabilizing of employment itself
provisions for social security however are protections for the future
our responsibility for the immediate necessities of the unemployed has been met by the congress
through the most comprehensive work plan in the history of the nation
our problem is to put to work three and one half million employable persons now on the relief rolls
it is a problem quite as much for private industry as for the government
we are losing no time getting the governments vast work relief programme under way
and we have every reason to believe that it should be in full swing by autumn
in directing it i shall recognize six fundamental principles
one the projects should be useful
projects shall be of a nature
that a considerable portion of the money spent
will go into wages for labor
projects will be sought which promised ultimate return to the federal treasury of a considerable proportion of the costs
funds allotted for each project should be actually and promptly spent and not held over until later years
in all cases projects must be of a character to give employment to those on the relief roles
six projects will be allocated to localities or relief areas in relation to the number of workers on relief rolls in those areas
i next want to make it clear exactly how we shall direct the work
i have set up a division of applications and information
to which all proposals for the expenditure of money must go for preliminary study and consideration
after the division of applications and information has sifted those projects
they will be sent to an allotment division composed of representatives of the more important governmental agencies
charged with carrying on work relief projects
the group will also include representatives of cities and of labor farming banking and industry
this allockment division will consider all of the recommendations submitted to it
and such projects as they approve will be next submitted to the president who under the act is required to make final allocations
the next step will be to notify the proper government agency
in whose field the project falls and also to notify another agency which i am creating a progress division
this division will have the duty of co ordinating the purchases of materials and supplies
and of making certain that people who are employed will be taken from the relief rolls
it will also have the responsibility of determining work payments and various localities
of making full use of existing employment services and to assist people engaged in relief work
to move as rapidly as possible back into private employment when such employment is available
mor ajor
this division will be charged with keeping projects moving on schedule
i have felt it to be essentially wise and prudent to avoid so far as possible
the creation of new governmental machinery for supervising this work
the national government now has at least sixty different agencies with the staff
and the experience and the competence necessary to carry on the two hundred and fifty or three hundred kinds of work that will be undertaken
these agencies therefore will simply be doing on a somewhat enlarged scale the same sort of things that they have been doing
this will make certain that the largest possible portion of the funds allotted
will be spent for actually creating new work and not for building up expensive overhead organizations here in washington
for many months preparations have been under way
the allotment of funds for desirable project has already begun
the key men for the major responsibilities of this great task already have been selected
i will realize that the country is expecting before this year is out to see the dirt fly as they say in carrying on the work
and i assure my fellow citizens that no energy will be spared in using these funds effectively
to make a major attack upon the problem of unemployment
our responsibility is to all of the people in this country
this is a great national crusade to destroy enforced idleness which is an enemy of the human spirit
generated by this depression
our attack upon these enemies must be without stint and without discrimination
no sectional no political distinctions can be permitted
it must however be recognized that when an enterprise of this character is extended over more than three thousand counties throughout the nation
there may be occasional instances of inefficiency bad management or misuse of funds
when cases of this kind occur
there will be those of course who will try to tell you that the exceptional failure is characteristic of the entire endeavour
it should be remembered that in every big job there are some imperfections
there are tiselers in every walk of life there are those in every industry who are guilty of unfair practices
every profession has its black sheep
but long experience in government has taught me
that the exceptional instances of wrong doing in government are probably less numerous than in almost every other line of endeavor
the most effective means of preventing such evils in this work's relief programme will be the eternal vigilance of the american people themselves
i call upon my fellow citizens everywhere to co operate with me
in making this the most efficient and the cleanest example of public enterprise the world has ever seen
it is time to provide a smashing answer for those cynical men who say that a democracy cannot be honest and efficient
if you will help this can be done
i therefore hope you will watch the work in every corner of this nation
feel free to criticize
tell me of instances where work can be done better or where improper practices prevail
neither you nor i want criticism conceived in a purely fault finding or partisan spirit
but i am jealous of the right of every citizen
to call to the attention of his or her government
examples of how the public money can be more effectively spent for the benefit of the american people
i now come my friends to a part of the remaining business before the congress
it has under consideration many measures
which provide for the rounding out of the programme of economic and social reconstruction
with which we have been concerned for two years
i can mention only a few of them to night
but i do not want my mention of specific measures
to be interpreted as lack of interest in
or disapproval of many other important proposals that are pending
the national industrial recovery act expires on the sixteenth of june
after careful consideration i have asked the congress to extend the life of this useful agency of government
as we have proceeded with the administration of this act
we have found from time to time
more and more useful ways of promoting its purposes
no reasonable person wants to abandon our present gains
we must continue to protect children
to enforce minimum wages
to prevent excessive hours
to safeguard
define and enforce collective bargaining
and
while retaining fair competition
to eliminate so far as humanly possible the kinds of unfair practices by selfish minorities which unfortunately
did more than anything else to bring about the recent collapse of industries
there is likewise pending before the congress
legislation to provide for the elimination
of unnecessary holding companies in the public utility field
i consider this legislation a positive recovery measure
power production in this country is virtually back to the nineteen twenty nine peak
the operating companies in the gas and electric utility field are by and large in good condition
not
under holding company domination
the utility industry has long been hopelessly at war within itself
and with public sentiment
by far
the greater part of the general decline in utility securities had occurred before i was inaugurated
the absentee management of unnecessary holding company control
has lost touch with
and has lost the sympathy of
the communities it pretends to serve
even more significantly
it has given the country as a whole
an uneasy apprehension
of overconcentrated economic power
a business that loses the confidence of its customers and the good will of the public
cannot long continue to be a good risk for the investor
this legislation
will serve the investor by ending the conditions which have caused that lack of confidence and good will
it will put the public utility operating industry on a sound basis for the future
both in its public relations and in its internal relations
this legislation will not only in the long run
result in providing lower electric an gas rates to the consumer
but it will protect the actual value and earning power of properties now owned by thousands of investors
who have little protection under the old laws against what use to be called
frenzied finance
it will not destroy values
not only business recovery but the general economic recovery of the nation will be greatly stimulated by the enactment of legislation
designed to improve the status of our transportation agencies
there is need for legislation providing for the regulation of interstate transportation by buses and trucks
for the regulation of transportation by water for the strengthening of our merchant marine an air transport
for the strengthening of the interstate commerce commission
to enable it to carry out a rounded conception of the national transportation system
in which the benefits of private ownership are retained while the public stake in these important services
is protected by the public's government
finally
the re establishment of public confidence in the banks of the nation
is one of the most hopeful results of our efforts as a nation to re establish public confidence in private banking
we all know that private banking actually exists
by virtue of the permissionof and regulation by the people as a whole
speaking through their government
wise public policy however requires not only that banking be safe
but that its resources be most fully utilized
in the economic life of the country
to this end it was decided more than twenty years ago
that the government should assume the responsibility
of providing a means by which the credit of the nation might be controlled
not by a few private banking institutions
but by a body with public prestige
and authority
the answer to this demand was the federal reserve system
twenty years of experience with this system
have justified the efforts made to create it
but these twenty years have shown by experience
definite possibilities for improvement
certain proposals made to amend the federal reserve act
deserve prompt and favorable action by the congress
they are a minimum of wise readjustments of our federal reserved system
in the light of past experience and present needs
these measures i have mentioned are in large part
the programme which under my constitutional duty i have recommended to the congress
they are essential factors in a rounded programme for national recovery
they contemplate the enrichment of our national life
by a sound and rational ordering of its various elements and wise provisions for the protection of the week against the strong
never since my inauguration in march nineteen thirty three
have i felt so unmistakably
the atmosphere of recovery
but it is more than the recovery of the material basis of our individual lives
it is the recovery of confidence in our democratic processes
and institutions
we have survived all of the arduous burdens and the threatening dangers of a great economic calamity
we have in the darkest moments of our national trials retained our faith
in our own ability to master our destiny
fear is vanishing
and confidence is growing on every side
renewed faith in the vast possibilities of human beings to improve their material and spiritual status
through the instrumentality of the democratic form of government
that faith is receiving its just reward
for that
we can be thankful to the god who watches over america
the fireside chats of franklin delino roosevelt by franklin d roosevelt section nine
march ninth nineteen thirty seven
part one
last thursday
i described in detail certain economic problems which every one admits now faced the nation
for the many messages which have come to me after that speech and which it is physically impossible to answer individually
i take this means of saying thank you
to night
sitting at my desk in the white house
i make my first radio report
to the people
in my second term of office
i am reminded of that evening in march four years ago
when i made my first radio report to you
we were then in the midst of the great banking crisis
soon after
with the authority of the congress
we asked the nation to turn over all of its privately held gold
dollar four dollar
to the government of the united states
to day's recovery proves how right that policy was
but when almost two years later
it came before the supreme court its constitutionality was upheld only by a five to four vote
the change of one vote would have thrown all the affairs of this great nation
dat
into hopeless chaos
in effect
four justices ruled
that the right under a private contract
to exact a pound of flesh was more sacred than the main objectives of the constitution to establish an enduring nation
in nineteen thirty three
you and i knew
tat we must never let our economic system get completely out of joint again
that we could not afford to take the risk of another great depression
we also became convinced
that the only way to avoid a repetition of those dark days
was to have a government with power to prevent
and to cure the abuses and the inequalities which had thrown that system out of joint
we then began a programme of remedying those abuses and inequalities
to give balance and stability to our economic system
to make it bom proof against the causes of nineteen twenty nine
to day
we are only part way through that programme
and recovery is speeding up to a point where the dangers of nineteen twenty nine are again becoming possible
not this week or month perhaps but within a year or two
national laws are needed to complete that programme
individual or local or state effort alone cannot protect us in nineteen thirty seven
any better than ten years ago
it will take time
and plenty of time
to work out our remedies administratively
even after legislation is past
to complete our programme of protection in time therefore
we cannot delay one moment in making certain
that our national government has power to carry through
four years ago
action did not come until the eleventh hour
it was almost too late
if we learned anything from the depression
we will not allow ourselves to run around in new circles a futile discussion
and debate
always postponing the day of decision
the american people have learned from the depression
ter
in the last three national elections
an overwhelming majority of them voted a mandate that the congress and the president begin the task of providing that protection
not after long years of debate
but now
the courts however
have cast doubts on the ability of the elected congress
to protect us against catastrophe
by meeting squarely our modern social and economic conditions
we are at a crisis in our ability to proceed with that protection
it is a quiet crisis
there are no lines of depositors outside closed banks
but to the far sighted
it is far reaching in its possibilities of injury to america
i want to talk with you very simply about the need for present action in this crisis
the need to meet
the unanswered challenge of one third of a nation
ill nourished
ill clad
ill housed
last thursday
i described the american form of government
as a three horse team provided by the constitution to the american people
so that their field might be plowed
the three horses are of course the three branches of government
the congress the executive and the corpse
two of the horses are pulling in unison to day
the third is naught
those who have intimated that the president of the united states is trying to drive that team
overlook the simple fact that the president
as chief executive
is himself one of the three horses
it is the american people themselves who are in the driver's seat
it is the american people themselves
who want the furrow ploud
it is the american people themselves
who expect the third horse to pull in unison
with the other two
i hope that you have re read the constitution of the united states in these past few weeks
like the bible
it ought to be read again and again
it is an easy document to understand
when you remember that it was called into being
because the articles of confederation under which the original thirteen states tried to operate
after the revolution
showed the need of a national government
with power enough to handle national problems
in its preamble
the constitution states that it was intended to form a more perfect union
and promote the general welfare
and the powers given to the congress to carry out those purposes
can be best described by saying
that they were all the powers needed to meet each and every problem
which then had a national character
and which could not be met by merely local action
but the framers went further
having in mind that in succeeding generations many other problems then undreamed of would become national problems
they gave to the congress
the ample broad powers to levy taxes
and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the united states
that my friends is what i honestly believe
to have been the clear and underlying purpose of the patriots who wrote a federal constitution to create a national government
with national power
intended as they said
to form a more perfect union
for ourselves and our posterity
for nearly twenty years there was no conflict between the congress and the court
congress passed a statute which in eighteen o three
the court said violated
an express provision of the constitution
the court claimed the power to declare it unconstitutional
and did so declare it
but a little later the court itself admitted
that it was an extraordinary power to exercise
and through mister justice washington
laid down this limitation upon it
it is but a decent respect due to the wisdom the integrity and the patriotism of the legislative body
by which any law is past
to presume in favor of its validity
until its violation of the constitution is proved beyond all reasonable doubt
but
since the rise of the modern movement for social and economic progress through legislation
the court has more and more often
and more and more boldly
asserted a power to veto laws passed by the congress and state legislatures
in complete disregard of this original limitation
in the last four years
the sound rule of giving statutes the benefit of all reasonable doubt
has been cast aside
the court has been acting not as a judicial body
but as a policy making
body
when the congress has sought to stabilize national agriculture
to improve the conditions of labor
to safeguard business against unfair competition
to protect our national resources and in many other ways to serve our clearly national needs
the majority of the court has been assuming the power to pass on the wisdom of these acts of the congress
and to approve or disapprove the public policy written into these laws
that is not only my accusation
it is the accusation of most distinguished justices of the present supreme court
i have not the time to quote to you all the language used by dissenting justices in many of these cases
but
in the case holding the railroad retirement act unconstitutional for instance
chief justice hughes said in a dissenting opinion
that the majority opinion was a departure from sound principles
and placed an unwarranted limitation
upon the commer's claws
and three other justices agreed with him
in the case of holding the a a a unconstitutional
just a stone said of the majority opinion that it was a tortured construction of the constitution
and two other justices agreed with him
in the case holding the new york minimum wage law unconstitutional
just a stone said
that the majority were actually reading into the constitution their own personal economic predilections
and thus
if the legislative power is not left free to choose the methods of solving the problems of poverty
subsistence and health of large numbers in the community
then
government is to be rendered impotet
and two other justices agreed with him
in the face of these dissenting opinions there is no basis for the claim made by some members of the court
that something in the constitution has compelled them regretfully to thwart the will of the people
in the face of such dissenting opinions it is perfectly clear that as chief justice hughes has said
we are under a constitution
but the constitution is what the judges say it is
the court in addition to the proper use of its judicial functions has improperly set itself up
as a third house of the congress
a super legislature as one of the justices has called it
reading into the constitution
words and implications which are not there and which were never intended to be there
we have therefore
reached the point as a nation where we must take action
to save the constitution from the court
and the court from itself
we must find a way to take an appeal from the supreme court to the constitution itself
we want a supreme court
which will do justice under the constitution
not over it
in our courts
we want a government of laws and not of men
i want
as all americans want
an independent judiciary
as proposed by the framers of the constitution
that means a supreme court that will enforce the constitution as written
that will refuse to amend the constitution by the arbitrary exercise of judicial power
amended by judicials say so
it does not mean a judiciary so independent that it can deny the existence of facts which are universally recognized
how then could we proceed to perform the mandate given us
it was said in last year's democratic platform
if these problems cannot be effectively solved within the constitution
we shall seek such clarifying amendments as will assure the power to enact those laws
adde quitly to regulate commerce
protect public health and safety
and safeguard economic security
in other words
we said we would seek an amendment
only if every other possible means by legislation
were to fail
when i commenced to review the situation
with the problem squarely before me
i came by a process of elimination to the conclusion that short of amendments
the only method which was clearly constitutional
and would at the same time carry out
other much needed reforms
was to infuse new blood into all our courts
we must have men worthy and equipped
to carry out impartial justice
but
at the same time
we must have judges who will bring to the courts
a present day sense of the constitution
judges who will retain in the court the judicial functions of a court
and reject the legislative powers which the courts have to day assumed
in forty five out of the forty eight states of the union
judges are chosen not for life
but for a period of years
in many states judges must retire at the age of seventy
congress has provided financial security
by offering life pensions at full pay for federal judges on all courts who are willing to retire at seventy
in the case of supreme court justices that pension is twenty thousand dollars a year
but all federal judges once appointed
can if they choose hold office for life
no matter how old they may get to be
the fireside cheps a franklin delino roosevelt by franklin d roosevelt
section ten march ninth nineteen thirty seven
part two
what is my proposal
it is simply this whenever a judge or justice of any federal court
has reached the age of seventy and does not avail himself of the opportunity to retire on a pension
a new member shall be appointed by the president then in office
with the approval as required by the constitution of the senate of the united states
that plan has two chief purposes
by bringing into the judicial system a steady and continuing stream of new and younger blood i hope first
to make the administration of all federal justice speedier and therefore less costly
secondly to bring to the decision of social and economic problems younger men who have had personal experience and contact
with modern facts and circumstances under which average men have to live and work
this plan will save our national constitution from hardening of the judicial arteries
the number of judges to be appointed would depend wholly on the decision of present judges now over seventy
or those who would subsequently reach the age of seventy
if for instance any one of the six justices of the supreme court now over the age of seventy should retire as provided under the plan
no additional place would be created
consequently although there never can be more than fifteen there may be only fourteen or thirteen or twelve
and there may be only nine
there is nothing novel or radical about this idea
it seeks to maintain the federal bench in full vigor
it has been discussed and approved by many persons of a high authority
ever since a similar proposal passed the house of representatives in eighteen sixty nine
why was the age fixed at seventye
because the laws of many states the practice of the civil service the regulations of the army and navy
and the rules of many of our university and of almost every great private business enterprise
commonly fix the retirement age at seventy years or less
the statute would apply to all the courts in the federal system
there is general approval so far as the lower federal courts are concerned
the plan has ment opposition only so far as the supreme court of the united states itself is concerned
if such a plan is good for the lower courts it certainly ought to be equally good for the highest court from which there is no appeal
those opposing this plan have sought to arouse prejudice and fear
by crying that i am seeking to pack the supreme court
and that a baneful precedent will be established
what do they mean by the words packing the court
let me answer this question with a bluntness that will end all honest misunderstanding of my purposes
if by that phrase pecking the court it is charged that i wished to place on the bench spineless puppets
who would disregard the law
and would decide specific cases as i wish them to be decided
i make this answer
that no president fit for his office would a point
and no senate of honourable men fit for their office would confirm that kind of appointis to the supreme court
but
if by that phrase the charge is made
that i would a point and the senate would confirm justice is worthy to sit beside present members of the court
who understand those modern conditions
that i will appoint justices who will not undertake
to override the judgment of the congress on legislative policy
that i will appoint justices who will act as justiceis and not has legislators
if the appointment of such justices can be called pecking the cortz
then i say that i and with me the vast majority of the american people favor doing just that thing now
is it a dangerous precedent for the congress to change the number of the justices
the congress has always had
and will have that power
the number of justices has been changed several times before
in the administration of john adams and thomas jefferson both signers of the declaration of independence
andrew jackson
abraham lincoln and ulysses s grant
i suggest only the addition of justices to the bench
in accordance with a clearly defined principle relating to a clearly defined age limit
fundamentally
if in the future
america cannot trust the congress it elects to refrain from abuse of our constitutional usages
democracy will have failed far beyond the importance to it
of any kind of precedent concerning the judiciary
we think it so much in the public interest to maintain a vigorous judiciary
that we encourage the retirement of elderly judges by offering them a life pension at full salary
why then should we leave the fulfilment of this public policy to chance
or make independent on upon the desire or prejudice of any individual justice
it is the clear intention of our public policy
to provide for a constant flow of new and younger blood
into the judiciary
normally
every president appoints a large number of district and circuit court judges and a few members of the supreme court
until my first term
practically every president of the united states has appointed at least one member of the supreme court
president taft appointed five members and named a chief justice
president wilson
three
president harding
fear
including a chief justice

president coolidge one
president hoover three including a chief justice
such a succession of appointments should have provided a court well balanced as to age
but chance and the disinclination of individuals to leave the supreme bench
have now given us a court in which five justices will be over seventy five years of age before next june
and one over seventy
thus a sound public policy has been defeated
i now propose that we establish by law
an assurance against any such ill balanced court in the future
i propose that hereafter
when a judge reaches the age of seventy
a new and younger judge shall be added to the court automatically
in this way i propose to enforce a sound public policy by law
instead of leaving the composition of our federal courts including the highest
to be determined by chance or the personal indecision of individuals
if such a law as i propose is regarded as establishing the new precedent
is it not a most desirable precident
like all lawyers like all americans
i regret the necessity of this controversy
but the welfare of the united states and indeed
of the constitution itself is what we all must think about first
our difficulty with a court to day rises not from the court as an institution
but from human beings within it
but we cannot yield our constitutional destiny to the personal judgment of a few men who being fearful of the future
would deny us the necessary means of dealing with the present
this plan of mine is no attack on the court
it seeks to restore the court to its rightful and historic place in our constitutional government
and to have it resume its high task of building anew on the constitution
a system of living law
the court itself can best undo what the court has done
i have thus explained to you the reasons that lie behind our efforts to secure results by legislation within the constitution
i hope that thereby the difficult process of constitutional amendment may be rendered unnecessary
but
let us examine the process
there are many types of amendment proposed
each one is radically different from the other
there is no substantial groups within the congress or outside it
who are agreed on any single amendment
it would take months or years to get substantial agreement upon the type and language of the amendment
it would take months and years thereafter
to get at two thirds majority in favor of that amendment in both houses of the congress
then would come the long course of ratification by three fourths of all the states
no amendment which any powerful economic interests or the leaders of any powerful political party have had reason to oppose
has ever been ratified within anything like a reasonable time
and thirteen states which contain only five per cent of the voting population
can block ratification
even though the thirty five states with ninety five per cent of the population are in favor of it
a very large percentage of newspaper publishers
chambers of commerce
bar association
manufacturers associations who are trying to give the impression that they really do want a constitutional amendment
would be the first to exclaim as soon as an amendment was proposed
oh i was for an amendment all right but this amendment you proposed is not the kind of amendment that i was thinking about
i am therefore going to spend my time my effort and my money
to block the amendment
although i would be awfully glad to help get some other kind of amendment ratified
two groups suppose my plan
on the ground that they favor a constitutional amendment
the first includes those who fundamentally object
two social and economic legislation along modern lines
this is the same group who during the campaign last fall tried to block the mandate of the people
now they are making a last stand
and the strategy of that last stand is to suggest the time consuming process of amendment in order to kill off by delay
the legislation demanded by the mandate
to them i say i do not think you will be able long to fool the american people as to your purposes
the other groups is composed of those who honestly believe the amendment process is the best
and who would be willing to support a reasonable amendment if they could agree on one
to them i say
we cannot rely on an amendment as the immediate or only answer to our present difficulties
when the time comes for action
you will find that many of those who pretend to support you
will sabitage any constructive amendment which is proposed
look at these strange bedfellows of yours
when before have you found them really at your side in your fights for progress
and remember one thing more
even if an amendment were past and even if in the years to come it were to be ratified
its meaning would depend upon the kind of justices who would be sitting on the supreme court bench
an amendment like the rest of the constitution
is what the justices say it is
rather than what its framers or you might hope it is
this proposal of mine will not infringe in the slightest upon the civil or religious liberties so dear to every american
my record as governor and president proves my devotion to those liberties
you who know me can have no fear that i would tolerate the destruction by any branch of government of any part of our heritage of freedom
the present attempt by those opposed to progress
to play upon the fears of danger to personal liberty
brings again to mind
that crude and cruel strategy tried by the same opposition
to frighten the workers of america in a pa envelope propaganda against the social security law
the workers were not fooled by that propaganda then
the people of america will not be fooled by such propaganda now
i am in favor of action through legislation
first because i believe that it can be passed at this session of the congress
second because it will provide a reinvigorated
liberal minded judiciary necessary to furnish quicker
and cheaper justice from bottom to
tup
third
because it will provide a series of federal courts willing to enforce the constitution as written
and unwilling to assert legislative powers by writing into it their own political and economic policies
during the past half century
the balance of power between the three great branches of the federal government
has been tipped out of balance by the courpse in direct contradiction of the high purposes of the framers of the constitution
it is my purpose to restore that balance
you who know me will accept my solemn assurance that in a world in which democracy is under attack
i seek to make american democracy succeed

organic functions part one
the facts dealing with the physiology of organisms the activities associated with that which we call life
are often designated organic functions
the terms animal physiology
plant physiology and human physiology
are in common use
and often suggest to the lay reader
that the functions or workings of the organs of plants animals or men are quite distinct
so much so
as to require discussion in different treatises
this is true only as a matter of detail
for in the past fifty years it has been made evident that in general principles
all living things are fundamentally similar
one of the most important summaries of this similarity
is huxley's famous essay
the border territory between the animal and vegetable kingdoms
written in eighteen seventy six
extracts from which follow
in the second edition of the rain animal published in eighteen twenty eight
couvier devotes a special section to the division of organized beings into animals and vegetables
in which the question is treated
with that comprehensiveness of knowledge and clear critical judgment
which characterize his writings
and justify biologists in regarding them as representative expressions of the most extensive if not the profoundest knowledge of his time
he affirms that living beings have been subdivided from the earliest times
into animated beings
which possess sense and motion
and inanimated beings which are devoid of these functions and simply vegetable
although the roots of plants direct themselves toward moisture
and their leaves toward air and light
although the parts of some plants exhibit oscillating movements without any perceptible cause
and the leaves of others retract when touched
yet none of these movements justify the escription to plants of perception of will
from the mobility of animals
couvier with his characteristic partiality for teleological reasoning
reduces the necessity of the existence in them of an alimentary cavity
or reservoir of food
whence their nutrition may be drawn by vessels
which are a sort of internal roots
and in the presence of this alimentary cavity
he naturally sees the primary
and the most important distinction between animals and plants
following out his teleological argument
couvier remarks that the organization of this cavity
and its appurtenances must needs vary according to the nature of the element and the operations which it has to undergo
before it can be converted into substances fitted for absorption
while the atmosphere and the earth supply plants with juices ready prepared
and which can be absorbed immediately
as the animal body required to be independent of heat and of the atmosphere
there were no means by which the motion of its fluids could be produced by internal causes
hence arose the second great distinctive character of animals or the circulatory system which is less important than the digestive
since it was unnecessary
and therefore is absent in the more simple animals
animals further needed muscles for locomotion and nerves for sensibility
hence says couvier
it was necessary that the chemical composition of the animal body should be more complicated
than that of the plant
and it is so inasmuch as an additional substance nitrogen
enters into it as an essential element
while in plants
nitrogen is only accidentally joined with the three other fundamental constituents of organic beings
carbon
hydrogen and oxygen
he afterward affirms that nitrogen is peculiar to animals and herein he places the third distinction between the animal and the plant
the soil and the atmosphere supply plants with water composed of hydrogen and oxygen
and carbonic acid
containing carbon and oxygen
they retained the hydrogen and the carbon
exhaled a superfluous oxygen
and absorbed little or no nitrogen
the essential character of vegetable life is the exhalation of oxygen
which is effected through the agency of light
animals on the contrary
derive their nourishment either directly or indirectly from plants
they get rid of the superfluous hydrogen and carbon
and accumulate nitrogen
the relations of plants and animals to the atmosphere are therefore in verse
the plant withdraws water and carbonic acid from the atmosphere
the animal contributes both to it
respiration
that is the absorption of oxygen and the exhalation of carbonic acid
is the specially animal function of animals and constitutes their forth distinctive character
thus wrote couvier in eighteen twenty eight
but in the fourth and fifth decades of this century
the greatest and most rapid revolution which biological science has ever undergone
was affected by the application of the modern microscope
to the investigation of organic structure
by the introduction of exact and easily manageable methods of conducting the chemical analysis of organic compounds and finally
by the employment of instruments of precision for the measurement of the physical forces which are at work in the living economy
that the semi fluid contents which we now term protoplasm
of the cells of certain plants
such as the charet are inconstant and regular motion was made out by boniventura corti a century ago
but the fact important as it was
fell into oblivion
and had to be rediscovered
by trevaronius in eighteen o seven
robert brown noted the more complex motions of the protoplasm in the cells a tradiscantia in eighteen thirty one
and now such movements of the living substance of plants are well known to be some of the most widely prevalent phenomena of vegetable life
a guard and other of the botanists of cuvier's generation
who occupied themselves with the lower plants had observed that
under particular circumstances the contents of the cells of certain water weeds were set free and moved about with considerable velocity
and with all the appearances of spontaneity as locomotive bodies
which from their similarity to animals of simple organization were called zeusspors
even as late as eighteen forty five however
a botanist of schlyden's eminence dealt very sceptically with these statements
and his skepticism was the more justified since erenburgh in his elaborate and comprehensive work on the infusoria
had declared the greater number
of what are now recognized as locomotive plants
to be animals
at the present day writes huxley
innumerable plants and free plant cells are known to pass the whole or part of their lives in an actively locomotive condition
in no wise distinguishable from that of one of the simpler animals and
while in this condition
their movements are to all appearances
as spontaneous as much the product of volition
as those of such animals
hence the teleological argument for cuvier's first diagnostic character
the presence and animals of an elementary cavity or internal pocket in which they can carry about their nutriment
has broken down so far at least as his mode of stating it goes
and
with the advance of microscopic anatomy
the universality of the fact itself among animals has ceased to be pradicable
many animals of even complex structure which live parasitically within others are wholly devoid of an alimentary cavity
their food is provided for them
not only ready cooked but ready digested
and the elementary canal
become superfluous has disappeared and again
the males of most rotefers have no digestive apparatus
finally amid the lowest forms of animal life
the speck of gelatinous protoplasm which constitutes the whole body
has no permanent digestive cavity or mouth
but takes in its food anywhere and digest so to speak
all over its body

although couvier's leading diagnosis of the animal from the plant will not stand a strict test
it remains one of the most constant of the distinctive characters of animals
and
if we substitute for the possession of an elementary cavity the power of taking solid nutriment into the body and there digesting it
the definition so changed will cover all animals except certain parasites
and the few and exceptional cases of non parasitic animals
which do not feed at all
on the other hand
the definition thus amended
will exclude all ordinary vegetable organisms
cuvier himself practically gives up his second distinctive mark when he admits that it is wanting in the simpler animals
the third distinction is based on a completely erroneous conception of the chemical differences
and resemblances between the constituents of animal and vegetable organisms for which couvier is not responsible
as it was current among contemporary chemists
it is now established
that nitrogen is as essential a constituent of vegetable as of animal living matter
and that the latter is chemically speaking
just as complicated as the former
starchy substances
sellyulose and sugar
once supposed to be exclusively confined to plants are now known to be regular and normal products of animals
amylaceous and sacraent substances are largely manufactured
even by the highest animals
celulos is widespread as a constituent of the skeletons of the lower animals
and it is probable that ammeloid substances are universally present in the animal organism though not in the precise form of starch
mere anger
although it remains true that there is an inverse relation between the green plant in sunshine and the animal
in so far as under these circumstances the green plant
decomposes carmonic acid and exhales oxygen while the animal absorbs oxygen and exhale's carbonic acid
yet the exact researches of the modern chemical investigators of the physiological processes of plants have clearly demonstrated the fallacy
of attempting to draw any general distinction between animals and vegetables
on this ground
in fact
the difference vanishes with the sunshine
even in the case of the green platt
which in the dark absorbs oxygen
and gives out carbonic acid like any animal
on the other hand
those plants such as the fungi
which contain no chloropil
and are not green are always so far as respiration is concerned in the exact position of animals
they absorb oxygen and give out carbonic acid
thus by the progress of knowledge
cuvier's forth distinction between the animal and the plant
has been as completely invalidated as the third and second and even the first can be retained only in a modified form
and subject to exceptions
but has the advance of biology simply tended to break down old distinctions without establishing new ones
with a qualification to be considered presently
the answer to this question is undoubtedly in the affirmative
the famous researches of shwan and schlyden in eighteen thirty seven and the following years
founded the modern science of histology
or that branch of anatomy which deals with the ultimate visible structure of organisms as revealed by the microscope
and from that day to this the rapid improvement of methods of investigation and the energy of a host of accurate observers
have given greater and greater breadth than firmness to schwan's great generalization
that a fundamental unity of structure obtains in animals and plants
and that
however diverse may be the fabrics or tissues of which their bodies are composed
all these varied structures result
from the metamorphosis of morthological units
termed cells in a more general sense than that in which the word sells was at first employed
which are not only similar in animals and in plants respectively
but present a close resemblance when those of animals and those of plants are compared together
the contractility which is the fundamental condition of locomotion
continues huckley
has not only been discovered to exist far more widely among plants than was formerly imagined
but in the plants the act of contraction has been found to be accompanied
as doctor burden sanderson's interesting investigations have shown by a disturbance of the electrical state of the contractile substance
comparable to that which was found by dubois raymond to be a concomitant of the activity of ordinary muscle in animals
again
i know of no test by which the reaction of the leaves of the sun dew and of other plants to stimuli so fully and carefully studied by mister darwin
can be distinguished from those acts of contraction following upon stimuli which are called reflex in animals
on each lobe of the bylobed leaf of venus fly trap are three delicate filaments
which stand out at right angles from the surface of the leaf
touch one of them with the end of a fine human hair
and the lobes of the leaf instantly closed together
in virtue of an act of contraction of part of their substance
just as the body of a snail contracts into its shell
when one of its horns is irritated
the reflex action of the snail is the result of the presence of a nervous system in the animal
a molecular change takes place in the nerve of the tentacle
is propagated to the muscles by which the body is retracted and causing them to contract the act of retraction is brought about
of course
the similarity of the acts does not necessarily involve the conclusion that the mechanism by which they are affected is the same
h
it suggests a suspicion of their identity
which needs careful testing
the results of inquiries into the structure of the nervous system of animals
converge toward the conclusion
that the nerve fibres which have been regarded as ultimate elements of nervous tissue
are not such
but are simply the visible aggregations of vastly more attenuated filaments
the diameter of which dwindles down to the limits of our present microscopic vision
greatly as these have been extended by modern improvements of the microscope and that a nerve is in its essence
nothing but a linear tract of specially modified protoplasm between two points of an organism
one of which is able to affect the other
by means of the communication so established
hence
it is conceivable that even the simplest living being may possess a nervous system
and the question whether plants are provided with a nervous system or not thus acquires a new aspect and presents the histologist and physiologist
with a problem of extreme difficulty
which must be attacked from a new point of view and by the aid of methods which have yet to be invented
thus it must be admitted he says again
that plants may be contractile and locomotivet
that while locomotive their movements may have as much appearance of spontaneity as those of the lowest animals
and that many exhibit actions comparable to those which are brought about by the agency of a nervous system in animals
and it must be allowed to be possible that further research may reveal the existence of something comparable to a nervous system in plants
so that i know not where we can hope to find any absolute distinction between animals and plants
unless we return to their mode of nutrition
and inquire whether certain differences of a more occult character than those imagined to exist by couvier
and which certainly hold good for the vast majority of animals and plants are of universal application
a being may be supplied with water
in which salts of ammonia and certain other mineral salts are dissolved in due proportion
with atmospheric air containing its ordinary minute dose of carbonic acid
and with nothing else but sunlight and heat
under these circumstances
unnatural as they are
with proper management the bein will thrust forth its radical and its plummule
the former will grow down into roots
the latter grow up into the stem and leaves of a vigorous beam plant
and this plant will in due time flour and produce its crop of beans just as if it were grown in the garden or in the field
the weight of the nitrogenous protein compounds
of the oily starchy sacaran and wooty substances contained in the full grown plant and its seeds
will be vastly greater than the weight of the same substances contained in the beang from which it sprang
but nothing has been supplied to the beam save water
carbonic acid
ammonia
potash lime
iron and the like in combination with phosphoric sulphuric and other acids
neither protein nor fat nor starch nor sugar nor any substance in the slightest degree resembling them
has formed part of the food of the beang
but the weights of the carbon
hydrogen oxygen nitrogen phosphorus sulphur and other elementary bodies contained in the bean plant
and in the seeds which it produces are exactly equivalent to the weights of the same elements which have disappeared from the materials supplied to the being during its growth
whence it follows that
the bean has taken in
only the raw materials of its fabric
and has manufactured them into beam stuffs
the bean has been able to perform this great chemical feat by the help of its green coloring matter or chlorofil
for it is only the green parts of the plant which under the influence of sunlight
have the marvellous power
of decomposing carbonic acid
setting free the oxygen and laying hold of the carbon which it contains
in fact the being obtains two of the absolutely indispensable elements of its substance from two distinct sources
the watery solution in which its roots are plunged
contains nitrogen but no carbon
the air to which the leaves are exposed contains carbon
but its nitrogen is in the state of a free gas in which condition the being can make no use of it
and the chlorofill is the apparatus by which the carbon is extracted from the atmospheric carbonic acid the leaves being the chief laboratories

life processes part one
nutrition thus as has been pointed out makes it possible to classify most organisms as animals or plants
yet there are many unicellular forms in which both kinds of nutrition go on at the same time
that is the forms may possess a mouth for the ingestion of solid food and green colouring matter chloropil
for the manufacture of starchy food from gaseous matter
many of the lowest forms of life have long been puzzles
and the beginner in biological study is surprised to find them described in text books of both botany and zoology
the fact is that they are on the border line are neither plants nor animals but simply organisms
since they cannot be classified it is necessary that they be listed both under botany and zoology in order to make sure that they will not be omitted entirely
because of these uncertain forms of life
heckel proposed once to include all one selled animals and plants in a third kingdom to be called protista meaning the first of all life
parker's definition of animals and plants
based on the foregoing considerations is convenient for distinguishing between animals and plants in all cases except the doubtful unicellular forms
he says animals are organisms of fixed and definite form in which the sole body is not covered with a cellulose wall
they injest solid protinacious food
they are nutritive processes result in oxidation
they have a definite organ of excretion and are capable of automatic movement
planks are organisms of constantly varying form in which the sale body is surrounded by a cellulose wall
they cannot injest solid food but are nourished by a watery solution of nutriant materials
if chlorophill is present the carbon dioxide of the air serves as a source of carbon
nitrogen is obtained from simple salts ad the nutritive processes result in doxidation
if chlorophillis absent carbon is obtained from sugar or some similar compound
nitrogen either from simple salts or from protydes and the process of nutrition is one of oxindation
there is no special excratory organ and except in the case of certain reproductive bodies there is usually no locomotion
the important point to recognize is that these boundaries are artificial and that there are no scientific frontiers in nature
as in the liquefaction of gases there is a critical point at which the substance under experiment is neither gaseous nor liquid
as in a mountainous country it is impossible to say where mountain ends and valley begins as in the development of an animal
it is featful to argue about the exact period when for instance the egg becomes a tadpole or the tadpole a frog
so in the case under discussion
the distinction between the higher plants and animals is perfectly sharp and obvious
but when the two groups are traced downward they are found gradually to merge
as it were into an assemblage of organisms which partake of the characters of both kingdoms and cannot without a certain violence
be either included in or excluded from either
when any given protest has to be classified the case must be decided on its individual merits
the organism must be compared in detail with all those which resemble it closely in structure physiology and life history
and then a balance must be struck and the doubtful form placed in the kingdom with which it has on the whole most points in common
it will no doubt occur to the reader that on the theory of evolution
the fact of the animal and vegetable kingdoms being related to one another like two trees united at the roots may be accounted for by the hypothesis that
the earliest organisms were protests
and that from them animals and plants were evolved along divergent lines of descent
and in this connection the fact that some bacteria the simplest organisms known and devoid of chlorofile
may flourish in solutions wholly devoid of organic matter is very significant
the lower plants and animals referred to above are so far from every day observation
and hence so unfamiliar that to most people the comparison made will mean little in terms of ordinary green flowering plants and common vertebrate animals
in order to emphasize the fundamental similarity of organic function in higher and lower animals and plants let us compare any higher plant
v g a bean plant with a higher animal eg frog or even man
in each the life is the sum total of a series of definite processes
nutrition or food supply
circulation metabolism
excretion
oxygenation part of respiration
movement
irritability nervous activity and reproduction
in turn these will be compared for the animal and the plant
following in part the comparisons of certain animals and plants by sedgwick and wilson and others
these comparisons will however be translated into terms applicable to any species of higher plants or animals
in the nutrition of the animal the most essential and characteristic part of the food supply is derived from vegetable
or animal matter in the form of various organic compounds of which the most important are protides protoplasum albumen et cetera
carbo hydrates starch cellulos and facts
these materials are used by the animal in the manufacture of new protoplasm to take the place of that which has been used up
it is however impossible for the animal to build these materials directly into the substance of its own body
they must first undergo certain preparatory chemical changes known collectively as digestion
and only after the completion of this process can all the food be absorbed into the circulation
for this purpose the food is taken not into the body proper
but into a kind of tubular chemical laboratory called the alimentary canal
through which it slowly passes being subjected meanwhile to the action of certain chemical substances or regions known as digestive formence
these substances which are dissolved in a watery liquid to form the digestive fluid are secreted by the walls of the elementary tube
through their action
the solid portions are liquefied and the food is rendered capable of absorption into the body proper
the food supply of the higher plant like that of the animal
is the source of the required matter and energy
but
unlike that of the animal
it is not chiefly an income of foods but only of the raw materials of food
matter enters the plant in the liquid or gaseous form by diffusion
both from the soil through the roots liquids and from the atmosphere through the leaves
gases
we have here the direct absorption into the body proper of foot stups precisely as the animal takes in water and oxygen
energy enters the plant to a small extent
as the potential energy of food stuffs but comes in principally as the cinetic energy of sunlight absorbed in the leaves
of the substances the solids salt et cetera must be dissolved in water before they can be taken in
water and dissolved salts continually pass by diffusion from the soil
into the roots where together they constitute the sack
the sap travels throughout the whole plant the main though not the only cause of movement
being the constant transpiration evaporation of watery vapour from the leaves especially through the stomata
the gaseous matters carbon dioxide
oxygen nitrogen

enter the plant mainly by diffusion from the atmosphere
are dissolved by the sap in the leaves and elsewhere and thus may pass to every portion of the plant
the green plant owes its power of absorbing the energy of sunlight
to the chlorofill bodies or chromataphors
for plants which like fungi et cetera are devoid of chloropill
are unable thus to acquire energy
entering the chlorofal bodies the cinnetic energy of sunlight is applied to the decomposition of carbon dioxide and water
after passing through many fold but imperfectly known processes
the elements of these substances finally reappear as starch
often in the form of grannules imbedded in the chlorofilled bodies and free oxygen most of which is returned to the atmosphere
this
the leaf of a green plant in the light is continually absorbing carbon dioxide and giving forth free oxygen
carbon dioxide and water contain no potential energy since the affinities of their constituent elements are completely satisfied
starch however contains potential energy since the molecule is relatively unstable
i e capable of decomposition into simpler stabler molecules in which stronger affinities are satisfied
and this is due to the fact that in the manufacture of starch in the chlorofill bodies
the cinnetic energy of sunlight was expended in lifting the atoms into position of vantage thus endowing them with energy of position
in this way some of the radiant and kinnetic energy of the sun comes to be stored up as potential energy in the starch
in short the green plant is able by co operation with sunlight to use simple raw materials carbon dioxide water oxygen et cetera
poor in energy or devoid of it and out of them to manufacture food
i e complex compounds rich inavailable potential energy
this power is possessed by green plants alone
all other organisms being dependent for energy upon the potential energy of ready made food
this must in the first instance be provided for them by green plants and hence without chlorofal bearing plants
animals and colorless plants as well apparently could not long exist
the plant absorbs also a small amount of kinnetic energy
independently of the sunlight in the form of heat
this however is probably not a source of vital energy but only contributes to the maintenance of the body temperature
food starch thus produced in the green leaves of higher plants and the inorganic foods
water nitrates or nitrates and various mineral substances in solution in water
furnish the materials and energy required for the life and growth of the plant
te circulatory system distributes these foods
in animals foods prepared for absorption in the stomach and intestine by digestion
are absorbed by the circulating liquids blood and lymph and transported to all celves of the animal body
in the plant the inorganic matter in water from the soil are absorbed by the roots and carried up definite tubes in the woody part of the stem
the causes of this ascent are not clear
but root pressure due to osmosis capullary action and evaporation from the leaves are factors
just as the solid food of animals must be digested in preparation for absorption
so starch manufactured in the leaves must be digested
dissolved
before it can be transported
this is done by diastace an enzine of plant cells
the change is from starch to a sugar capable of diffusion
dissolved in water the sugar is transported down delicate tubes chiefly in the growing bark region of the stem
it is clear that there are upward and downward currents of water containing food comparable to blood of an animal
but no system of complete circulation as in the blood vessels of a higher animal
however the result in distributed food
is the same in the plant
and in the animal
in the cells the foods undergo metabolic changes
in an animal the foods in the circulating liquids blood and lympth
are selected and absorbed by the cells
only protide foods form new protoplasm
and even of protydes only a limited amount
seventy five to one hundred grams a day for a man
is built into new protoplasm
the excess undergoes oxidation
and forms nitrogen excretions
the foods containing only the elements carbon hydrogen and oxygen fats and carbo hydrates
i directly oxidized to excretions and lacking nitrogen cannot serve from making new animal protoplasm
fat and carbolhydrate foods then never become living matter
they may be stored especially as fat
until needed for oxidation to supply energy
the building up of the protoplasm from protides is anabolism
constructive metabolism
the destruction of protoplasm
excess protides o'r the fat and carbolhydrate foods is catabolism
destructive metabolism
catabolism is probably due to ensine action
but the final result is chiefly carbon dioxide and water
which could be derived by the ordinary chemical evolution of protoplasm protide sugar starch or fax
in the plant starch as has been seen
is first formed in the chlorofilled bodies
but the formation of starch all important as it is is after all only the manufacture of food
as a preliminary to the real processes of nutrition
these processes must take place everywhere in ordinary protoplasm
for it is here that oxidation occurs and the need for a renewal of matter and energy consequently arises
sooner or later the starch grains are changed into a kind of sugar
glucos which unlike starch dissolves in the sack
and may thus be easily transported to all parts of the plant
wherever there is need for new protoplasm
whether to repair previous waste
or to supply materials for growth
after absorption into the cells the elements of the starch or glue cose are by the living protoplasm in some unknown way
combined with nitrogen and sulphur probably also with salt water et cetera to form protyde matter
the particles of this newly formed compound are incorporated into the protoplasm
if a larger quantity of starches formed in the chlorofill bodies than is immediately needed by the protoplasm for purposes of repair or growth
it may be reconverted into starch after journeying as glukos through the plant
and be laid down as reserve starch in the cells of root or stem or elsewhere
apparently when this reserve supply is finally needed at any point in the plant it is again changed to glucose and transported thither
it is probable that new leaves and new tissues generally are always formed in part from this reserve starch
in the plant as in the animal metabolism must consist of anabolic and catabolic processes
the construction in the cells of new protyde from the absorbed carbohydrate and the materials from the soil is true anabolism
it is also clear that catabolism or oxidation for the liberation of energy
occurs as in animals but this process is slower
probably foods containing carbon
hydrogen and oxygen are the sources of energy in the higher plants as in animals
in both plants and animals simple waste substances result from the catabolic processes in the cells
in the animal
carbon dioxide water and nitrogen compounds are the chief excretions
they are absorbed by the circulating liquids and carried to the eliminating organs lungs and kidneys chiefly for elimination
in the higher plants the excretions or carbon dioxide which escapes through the epidermis of root stem and leaf and through the stomata
water which is lost by evaporation especially from the leaf surface through the stamata
excretions which are lost by osmosis through the roots
and the accumulated but useless mineral substances which are eliminated by leaf fall
in both animals and plants
oxygen is essential to the catabolic part of metabolism
hence oxygen must be supplied to the cells
oxygenation is the term used to denote the oxygen supplying part of respiration
the other part of respiration
elimination of carbon dioxide has been treated under excretions
in the animal
oxygen is absorbed by the blood
in excess by the haemoglobin of the red cells of the blood
and later is absorbed from the blood and lympth by all the living cells
in the plant also
oxygen is absorbed through the epidermis and stomata from the air
this process is however obscured during the day because of the oxygen freed in the manufacture of starch which goes on at that time
probably this freed oxygen is used for the purpose of oxygenation but more is freed in the photo synthetic process than is needed for oxygenation
and hence the excess oxygen is eliminated
while starchmenufacture is in process
in comparing a higher animal and a green plant
confusion must be avoided regarding the part played by oxygen and carbon dioxide in true respiration
with the part played by the same substances in starch formation photosynthesis
in non green plants like the indian pipe and mushrooms the breathing of oxygen and the excretion of carbon dioxide are as in the animal
this is true also of green plants in darkness and even in the light of all parts of green plants except the chlorofil bodies
these constitute a sort of extra mechanism enabling green plants to make their own carbohydrate food
imagine a higher animal with an attachment for turning the carbon dioxide and water excreeted
back to start usable as food
and the comparison of the green plant and the animal would be complete

morphology and embreality part one
the facts of biology which admit
of adequate explanation only in connection with the theory of dessent
are grouped
by belmaynes and other writers on organic
evolution
under the heads of morphology
embreoligy
classification
talaeontology
distribution and domestication
in all these lines
the facts are drawn together by a strong thread of unity
there are numberless similarities
and correlations and surprising uniformities
the great variety of life as exhibited in the countless species of plants and animals has been referred to

and yet
great as this variety is
there are after all
only a few types of structure among all animals and plants
some three or four or eight or ten general modes of development
and all the rest are modifications from these few types
it is moreover true
that all living forms are but series of modifications and extensions of one single plan of structure
all have the same ultimate substance
the mysterious semi fluid network of protoplasm
which is so far as is known
the physical basis of all life
and the equally mysterious nucleer substance
work for matin
which in some fashion presides over all the movements of the protoplasm
and is the physical basis of the phenomena of heredity
the same laws of heredity
variability and of response to outside stimulus
hold in all parts of the organic world
all organisms have the same need of reproduction
all are forced to make concession after concession
to their surroundings
and in these concessions
all progress in life consists
and at last
each organism or each alliance of organisms
must come to the greatest concession of all
which is called death
the unity in life then
is not less a fact
than is life's great diversity
whatever emphasis is laid upon the diversity of life
the essential unity of all organisms must not be forgotten
an examination of the facts in each of the lines of evidence
make it clear
that the only reasonable explanation for the existence of a fundamental unity in organic life
is the theory of descent
i e that similarities are due to blood relationship
and that differences come from adaptive modifications
the facts adduced from morthology
being the result of researches into the structure of adult animals and plants
lead to a preview of certain principles of adaptation necessary for their interpretation
first
it must be noted that
some structures are not
non adaptive
that is
do not change to fit changed habits or conditions of life
such structures or organs are most often found internally
for illustration
a change in the locomotive habit of a bird
from that of flying to that of an ostrich
is associated
with an adaptive modification of locomotire structures
legs and wings
but not in any striking way is their change in the internal organs
internal organs may persist unchanged
and hence they offer good guides to classification
on the other hand
external structures are likely to undergo adaptation
when habits or conditions of life change
hence as jordan has said
the inside of an animal tells the real history of its ancestry
the outside tells us only where its ancestors have been
in the second place
it must be noted
that adaptations to similar conditions
may result in superficial resemblances
for example
there is a superficial resemblance
between the wing of an insect
and the wing of a bird
both adaptations to an aerial environment
between the heart of an insect
and the heart of a vertebrate animal
both adaptations for pumping blood
between the fin of a fish
and the paddle of a wheel
both adaptive swimming organs
yet
the resemblance in these cases does not go deeper than the surface
it is one a function
only
all such cases of resemblance and function
but not in detailed plan of structure
are called analogies
and mean nothing more than similarity of environment
turning to more fundamental resemblances
such as the wing of a bat
and the wing of a bird
careful study shows detailed internal
as well as external similarities of structure
ih
such cases are homologies
on the one hand then are found structures which are perfectly analogous and yet in no way homologous
totally different structures are modified to perform the same functions
on the other hand are found structures which are perfectly homologous and yet in no way analogous
the structural elements remain
but are profoundly modified to perform totally different functions
homology thus means identity of structure which is the result of identity of parentage
it is the stamp of heredity
it means blood relationship
these principles of homology are essential to a correct interpretation of the facts of morphology
the most striking fact of similar structure among plants and among animals is the existence of a common general plan in any group
since backboned animals are best known to most readers they may be taken as an illustration
all vertebrate animals and none other says la conte
have an iternal jointed skeleton worked by muscles on the outside
the relation of skeleton and muscle and arthurpods is exactly the reverse
in all vertebrats
and in none other
the axis of this skeleton is a jointed backbod
vertibral column
inclosing and protecting the nervous centres cerebra spinal axis
these therefore may well be called backboned animals
all vertibrantes and none other
have a number of their anterior vertical joints enlarged and consolidated into a box to form the skull
in order to inclose and protect a similar enlargement of the nervous centre
viz the brain
and also usually
but not always a number of posterior joints
enlarged and consolidated to form the pelvis to serve as a firm support to the hind limbs
all vertebrates and none other
have two cavities
inclosed and protected by the skeleton viz the nural cavity above and the visceral or body cavity below the vertebral column
all vertebrates with few exceptions and no other animals
have two and only two pair of limbs
the exceptions are of two kinds viz a some lowest fishes
amphioxes and lampreys
which probably represent the vertebrate condition before limbs were acquired
and b degenerate forms like snakes and some lizards which have lost their limbs by disuse
so much concerns the general plan of skeleton structures and is strongly suggestive of in fact it is inexplicable without common origin
but much more remains which is not only suggestive but demonstrative of such origin
by extensive comparison in the taxanomic and antigenic series the whole vertebrate structure in all its details indifferent animals
may be shown to be modifications one of another
sometimes at piece is enlarged sometimes diminished or even becomes obsolete
sometimes several pieces are consolidated into one
but in spite of all these obscurations corresponding parts usually may be made out
these remarkable similarities in the common general plan alone are convincing evidences of descent
but attention may be called to a like similarity extending to the details of structure
for example
the wings of a bat a mammal
a bird and a fussil flying reptile all show the same bones adaptively modified
a series of either four or hind limbs of a mammel with one toe horse
to toes sheep four toes hog and five toes dog
exhibit a remarkable series of homologies pointing to a five toaed ancestor
and any other series of organs of vertebrates would give the same evidence of fundamental resemblances homologies
for such a series of facts the reader must be referred to special books like weater shimes comparative anatomy of the vertibrates
romayne's darwin and after darwin
and la conte's evolution
the existence of great similarities in vertebrate structure is not always fully recognized
to the superficial observer the bodies of animals of different classes seem to differ fundamentally in plan
to bhe entirely different machines made each for its own purposes at once out of hand
extensive comparison on the contrary shows them to be the same although the essential identity is obscured by adaptive modifications
the simplest in fact the only scientific explanation of the phenomena a vertebrate structure is the idea of a primal vertebrate
modified more and more through successive generations by the necessities of different modes of life
see then the difference between man's mode of working and natures
a man having made a steam engine and desiring to use it for a different purpose from that for which it was first designed and used
will nearly always be compelled to add new parts not contemplated in the original machine
nature rarely makes new parts never if she can avoid it but on the contrary adapts an old part to the new function
it is as if nature were not free to use any and every device to accomplish her end but were conditioned by her own plans of structure
as indeed she must be according to the derivation theory
thus
in the fin of a fish
the fore paw of a reptile
or emammel
the wing of a bird
and the arm and hand of a man
is found the same part
variously modified for many purposes
another striking class of the facts of morphology which admit of scientific explanation only along the line of homology
are the thousands of cases of rudimentary or vestigial structures to be found
throughout both the animal and vegetable kingdoms dwarfed and useless representatives of organs are constantly met with
which in other and allied kinds of animals and plants are of large size and functional utility
thus for instance the unborn whale has rudimentary teeth
which are never destined to cut the gums and throughout its life this animal retains in a similarly rudimentary condition
a number of organs which never could have been of use to any kind of creature save a terrestrial quadruped
other well known examples among vertebrates are
vestiges of hind limbs in certain snakes
reduced wings in the apteriks and ostriches
rudiments of eyes in cave fishes hind limbs beneath the skin of whales
the verma form appendix in man
as well as useless muscles to move the ears and the skin and also a very much reduced hairy covering over the surface of the body
waitersheim has recorded more than one hundred and eighty such structural reminiscences in man
now rudimentary organs of this kind are of such frequent occurrence that almost every species of organism presents one or more of them
usually indeed a considerable number
how then are they to be accounted for
of course the theory of descent with adaptive modification has a simple answer to supply
namely that when from changed conditions of life an organ which was previously useful becomes useless
it will be suffered to dwindle away in successive generations under the influence of certain natural causes
on the other hand the theory of special creation can only maintain that these rudiments are formed for the sake of adhering to an ideal type
now here again the former theory appears to be triumphant over the latter says romaynes
for without waiting to dispute the wisdom of making dwarfed and useless structures merely for the whimsical motive assigned
surely if such a method were adopted in so many cases
we should expect that inconsistency it would be adopted in all cases
this reasonable expectation however is far from being realized
in numberless cases such as that of the four limbs of serpents no vestige of a rudiment is present
but the vacillating policy in the matter of rudiments does not end here
for it is shown in a still more aggravated form
where within the limits of the same natural group of organisms a rudiment is sometimes present and sometimes absent
for instance
although in nearly all the numerous species of snakes
there are no vestiges of limbs
in the python we find very tiny rudiments of the hind limbs
m
is it a worthy conception of deity that
while neglecting to maintain his unity of ideal in the case of nearly all the numerous species of snakes he should have added a tiny rudiment in the case of the python
and even in that case should have maintained his ideal very inefficiently inasmuch as only two limbs instead of four are represented
convincing as are the evidences of descent recorded in the structure of plants and animals
these evidences have been in the past thirty years somewhat overshadowed by the far more surprising evidences
of descent discovered in the development of plant and animal embryos
a dozen volumes would be necessary
to present the mass of embryological evidence but a few salient facts will illustrate the kind of evidence to be deduced from embryology
most remarkable of all the principles which have been discovered by embryologists is the recapitulation doctrine
which briefly stated is that individual development antageny
recapitulate ancestral history
fhilogeny
illustrations quoted from the works of romaynes and la conte
will make this principle clear
it is an observable facts as remains
that there is often a close correspondence between developmental changes as revealed by any chronological series of fossils which may happen to have been preserved
and developmental changes which may be observed during the life history of now existing individuals belonging to the same group of animals
is closely reproduced in the life history of existing dear
or in other words
the antlers of an existing deer furnish in their development a kind of resumeh or recapitulation of the successive phases
whereby the primitive horn was gradually superseded by horns presenting a greater and greater number of prongs in successive species of extinct dear
n
it must be obvious
that such a recapitulation in the life history of an existing animal of developmental changes successively distinctive of sundry alive
though now extinct species speak strongly in favor of evolution
here
as it is of the essence of this theory that new forms arise from older forms by way of hereditary descent
we should antecedently expect if the theory is true
that the phases of development presented by the individual organism would follow
in their main outlines those phases of development
through which their long line of ancestors had passed
the only alternative view is that a species of deer
for instance were separately created additional prongs were successively added to their antlers and yet that
in order to be so added to successive species
every individual dear belonging to later species
was required to repeat in his own lifetime
the process of successive editions which had previously taken place in a remote series of extinct species
now i do not deny that this view is a possible view but i do deny that it is a probable one
according to the evolutionary interpretation of such facts we can see a very good reason why the life history of the individual
is thus a condensed resume of the life history of its ancestral species
but
according to the opposite view
no reason can be assigned why such should be the case
it is well known likewise comments la conte
that the embryo or lava of a frog or toad
when first hatched
is a leglers
tail swimming
water breathing
gill breathing animal
it is essentially a fish
and would be so classed if it remained in this condition
the fish retains permanently this form
but the frog passes on
next it forms first one pair and then another pair of legs and meanwhile
it begins to breed also by lungs
at this stage it breathes equally by lungs and by gills i ea both air and water
n
the lower forms of amphibians such as suradan
men o brocchus
siren et cetera
retain permanently this form
and are therefore called pyrenny bronx
but the frog still passes on
then the gills gradually dry up as the lungs develop
and they now breathe wholly by lungs but still retained the tale
now this is the permanent mature condition of many amphibians
such as the triton
the salamander et cetera which are therefore called
caduc a bronx
but the frog still passes on
finally it loses the tail or rather
its tail is absorbed
and its material used in further development
and it becomes a perfect frog
the highest order
anora of this class
thus then in antageny
the fish goes no further than the fish stages
the pyrenna bronc passes through the fish stage to the parennibronc amphibian
the cadusabronc
takes first the fish form
then the paranny brockh form
and finally they coldduce a bronch form
but goes no further
last
the annura takes first the fish form
then that of the pyranna broch
then that of the cadoucy bronc
and finally becomes anora
now this is undoubtedly the order of succession of forms in geological times i e in the philogenic series
fishes first appeared in the devonian and upper silurian in very reptilian or rather amphibian forms
then in the carboniferous
fishes still continuing
there appeared the lowest i e most fish like forms of amphibians
these were undoubtedly pyranna bronks
in the permian and triassic
higher forms appeared
which were certainly caduci bronc
finally only in the tertiary so far as we yet know
to the highest form anura appear
the general similarity of the three series is complete

the walls of babylon
in the old city of damascus
you climb to the hump of a tall fleet dromedary
with guides and guards about you
i
you ride through the covered bazaars crowded with the dark faced arabs in strange costumes
and along the narrow winding lane which was once called the street called straiht
leaving the city by the eastern gate and passing a small village or two
you ascend the hill to the plateau and before you as far as the eye can reach stretches the great arabian desert
with mingling fear and wonder at the mystery always lying beyond the desert horizon
you tap gently with your heel upon the shoulder of the dromedary to urge her on
at first paying little heed to you she hesitates and glances anxiously about the desert as if in search of an enemy
now and then she reaches down to graze the thorny argul along the way
as the taps upon her shoulder are repeated
she stretches out her long neck
and with long strides
makes for the eastern horizon
she realizes that she is bound on the long journey across the desert
hour after hour she bears you over the hard monotonous plain
the damascus mosques and their minarets sink beneath the western sky
the desert about you shows no signs of life
only a tall column of whirling sand rearing its head until it is lost in the blue above moves majestically along
in the distance your eyes detect a beautiful lake with shores fringed with trees
but soon the phantom lake vanishes while others still farther beyond appear and vanish in rapid succession
like a great ball of fire the sun sinks in the west
the stars come out one by one and shine brighter than elsewhere as if to light you on your way
late at night the weary dromedary meals and on the ground close beside her you lie down to sleep
again long before the stars have been scattered by the morning sun you are on your way
day after day you travel on scorched by the heat of noonday shivering in the chill winds of the night
two weeks passed and at last you stand on the eastern edge of the plateau
gazing down upon the great euphrates winding along the valley beneath
you have crossed the arabian desert
the first stage of the long journey to the walls of babylon
here in the valley the water is sweet and the food abundant
for ten days you follow down the river through little villages and black tent encampments among scenes of strange arab life which never lose their charm
everywhere the valley is dotted with the mounds of buried cities carefully guarding the secrets of the centuries of long ago
at last you see before you a mound rising like a mountain from the level plain
your journey is at an end
before you is babylon the gait of god as the old name means
about you is all that remains of the second of the seven wonders of the world
babylon
even in the days of nebukhednezzar was an old old city
there is a hebrew tradition that it was the oldest of all cities but now we know that great empires flourished and passed away before babylon was built
old king sargan the first who may have lived as early as three thousand eight hundred b c
seems to have been the first to mention babylon and one of his inscriptions seems to say that he built the city and gave it its name
but in those very early days babylon was little more than a shrine surrounded with mud huts and date palms
it was about twenty two fifty b c when the great hammurabi made it his capital that it became the chief city of babylonia
its history for the next fifteen hundred years or more is obscure
we know the names of its kings and the records speak of long wars with the assyrians
in the year six eighty nine b c sinna cherub king of nineveh captured babylon
tore down its palaces and temples and walls and scraped even the foundations of the city into the river
the place where the old city had stood for three thousand years again became a desert
eser haddon the son of sine cherub was the next king of nineveh
he rebuilt babylon that in accordance with the ancient custom he might be crowned in the sacred city
when eser hadn't died one of his sons samus some ukin was made king of babylon
another son asser bonni pall or the great sardanapolis of the greeks became the king of nineveh
war broke out between the two brothers and again babylon was captured
in six twenty six aster bonnipalte died
and in that same year navo polassar the father of the great nebucitnezzar became the king of babylon
the building of the babylons so famous in history began with nabo palassar
he enlarged the old city erected temples and began the construction of its walls
in six o six nineveh the old enemy of babylon fell never to rise again
the next year in six o five nave palassar died and nevekid nezzar succeeded him to the throne
he continued the building operations of his father until babylon became the greatest city of its age
and surrounded it with walls the like of which no other city has ever seen
never could nezer or never could dress her as his name should be spelled was the greatest character in babylonian history
but about his name so many legends have grown that it is sometimes difficult to learn the facts of his life
early he married amuhia a daughter of the median king
his military career began while he was still the crown prince and his father was on the throne
in six o five
at the head of the babylonian army he defeated the egyptians in the famous battle of kar kemish the old hittite capital
and drove them from asia
then syria and palestine were added to his future empire
in five ninety seven when he sent his army to jerusalem he won the hatred of the jews by taking jehoeacen the king captive
eleven years later in five eighty six he destroyed the sacred hebrew city
transported the jews to babylon and brought the hebrew kingdom to an end
centuries afterward even to this day jewish mothers teach their children to hate his name
they tell how he forced the exiles to carry heavy bags of sand across the desert to increase their burdens
how he cast hebrew lads into a fiery furnace and into the lions den
and how in punishment for all his wickedness he became a calf and for seven years grazed the grass and the fields about the city
late in his life in five sixty seven he invaded egypt
during all his reign there was little peace in his great mixed turbulent empire
the walls of the palaces of many of the assyrian kings were lined with great stone slabs engraved with reliefs and sometimes with the portrait of a king
but in babylonia stone was difficult to obtain and sculptures were very rare
therefore it was useless to hope that never cad nezzar's portrait would be found on his palace walls
however several decades ago an oriental appeared at the berlin museum
offering for sale a small cameo engraved with a helmeted head of a greek type
about the head was an inscription in greek characters
saying that the face was that of nebucidnezzar
the museum authorities believed that the cameo was one of the many spurious objects which the eastern forgers were constantly sending to europe
yet they took an impression of it and returned it to its owner
years later when the archaeologists could readily distinguish the false from the true
it was recognized that the cameo was genuine and that it bore the likeness of the great king
unfortunately the little stone seal perhaps the only one to preserve for us his features appears to have been lost forever
its impression shows the face of a beardless young man intelligent and refined
the eyes are suggestive of the semitic the nose is of the greek type
the lips are thin the chin prominent the neck is that of a strong vigorous man
such was the appearance of the builder of the walls of babylon
religion and cruelty frequently go hand in hand and never could nezar was exceedingly religious
though a great warrior it was not for his military deeds that he was best known
he was fond of restoring the ruined temples of the old babylonian cities
and most of the records which have come from his time speak chiefly of his deeds of peety
read the introduction to any of his inscriptions of which the following is one and you will call him vain and proud
but his scribe wrote it in the manner customary for the scribes of those days to write of their royal masters
never could nezzar king of babylon the exalted prince the favorite of marduke the lofty potessye
the beloved of nappu
the arbiter the possessor of wisdom who seeks out the path of their divinity
who reverences their lordship
the untiring governor who ponders daily concerning the maintenance of esigile and ezita
and is continually anxious for the shrines of babylon and borsippa
the wise the pious the maintainer of esigil and ezita
the first born son of nabo palaser king of babylon am i
however cruel and religiously intolerant never could nezur may have been he was undoubtedly the greatest builder the world has ever seen
there is scarcely one of the thousands of ruined mounds in babylonia which does not contain bricks bearing his name
there is scarcely a royal record from his reign which is not chiefly occupied with the descriptions of his building operations
he rebuilt scores of the ancient temples surrounded many cities with walls
lined the shores of the rivers with embankments and spanned the rivers with bridges
tradition says that to please his foreign wife from the mountainous country he built the famous hanging gardens but that may be only a tradition
his palace in babylon was one of the world's largest buildings but the walls with which he protected his palace and city where the wonder of the whole world
the ancients never tired of describing them
fortunately in several of his long inscriptions recently discovered in the babylonian mounds never could ness or speaks of the building of the walls
in one of them he says
i completed imgur bell and nimity bell the great walls of babylon the mighty city
the city of his exalted power
at the entrance of the great gates i erected strong bowls of bronze and terrible serpents standing upright
my father did that which no previous king had done
with mortar and bricks he built two moat walls about the city
and i with mortar and bricks built a third great moat wall and joined it and united it closely with the moat walls of my father
i laid its foundation deep to the water level
i raised its summit mountain high i constructed a moat wall of burned bricks about the west wall of babylon
my father built the moat wall of the erectu canal securely with mortar and bricks
he built well the quays along the opposite shore of the euphrates but he did not finish all his work
but i his first born
the beloved of his heart
built the moat walls of eraktu with mortar and bricks and joining them together with those of my father made them very solid
a thing which no king before had ever done
to the west of babylon at a greater distance from the outer wall i constructed an enclosing wool four thousand cubits in length about the city
i dug its moat to the water level
i walled up its side with mortar and burned bricks and i united it securely with the moat walls of my father
along its edge i built a great wall of mortar and burned bricks mountain high
borosis a priest of the temple of belle at babylon writing about two fifty b c
was living in the city while the walls were still standing though in a ruinous condition
his brief description of them should not be omitted he says tat never could nezer
built three walls round about the inner city and three others about that which was the outer and this he did with burnt brick
and after he had walled the city and adorned its gates he built another palace before his father's palace but so that they joined to it
to describe whose vast height and immense riches it would perhaps be too much for me to attempt
yet as large and lofty as they were they were completed in fifteen days
he also erected elevated places for walking of stone and made it resemble mountains and built it so that it might be planted with all sorts of trees
he also erected what is called a pencile paradise
of all the ancient descriptions of the famous walls and the city they protected
that of herodotus is the fullest
perhaps heroditus had never been in babylon
perhaps the tales that travellers told him were exaggerated as traveller's tales are likely to be
yet he at least tried to be accurate he says
the city stands on a broad plain and is an exact square a hundred and twenty furlongs in length each way
so that the entire circuit is four hundred and eighty furlongs
well such is its size in magnificence there is no other city that approaches to it
it is surrounded in the first place by a broad and deep moat full of water behind which rises a wall
fifty royal cubits in width and two hundred in height
and here i may not omit to tell the use to which the mould dug out of the great moat was turned nor the manner wherein the wall was wrought
as fast as they dug the moat the soil which they got from the cutting was made into bricks
and when a sufficient number were completed they baked the bricks in kilns
then they set to building
and began by bricking the borders of the moat after which they proceeded to construct the wall itself
using throughout for their cement hot bitumen and interposing a layer of wattled reeds at every thirtieth course of the bricks
on the top along the edges of the wall they constructed buildings of a single chamber facing one another
leaving between them room for a fore horse chariot to turn
in the circuit of the wall are a hundred gates all of brass
with brazen lintels and sideposts
the bitumen used in the work was brought to babylon from is a small stream which flows into the euphrates
at the point where the city of the same name stands eight days journey from babylon
lumps of bitumen are found in great abundance in this river
the city is divided into two portions by the river which runs through the midst of it
this river is the euphrates a broad deep swift stream which rises in armenia and empties itself into the erythrian sea
the city wall is brought down on both sides to the edge of the stream
thence from the corners of the wall there is carried along each bank of the river a fence of burnt bricks
the houses are mostly three and four stories high
the streets all run in straight lines not only those parallel to the river but also the cross streets which lead down to the water side
at the river end of these cross streets are low gates in the fence that skirts the stream
which are like the great gates in the outer wall of brass and open on the water
the outer wall is the main defence of the city
there is however a second inner wall of less thickness than the first but very little inferior to it in strength
the centere of each division of the town is occupied by a fortress
in the one stood the palace of the kings surrounded by a wall of great strength and size
in the other was the sacred precinct of jupiter bellas
a square enclosure two furlongs each way with gates of solid brass which was also remaining in my time
in the middle of the precinct there was a tower of solid masonry of forlong in length and breadth
upon which was raised a second tower and on that a third and so on up to eight
the ascent to the top is on the outside by a path which winds round all the towers
when one is about half way up one finds a resting place and seats where persons are wont to sit sometimes on their way to the summit
other ancient descriptions of the walls have been left us by ceseus of the fifth century b c and by stramo of the beginning of the christian era
but they add little to our knowledge
should we compare these ancient descriptions of the walls we should find them hopelessly conflicting
however they teach us that in those early days when most cities were surrounded by enormous walls
the walls of babylon were so long and wide and high that all who saw them were amazed
it is only from their ruins that we may hope to obtain accurate information of the strongest fortifications in the ancient world
in the year five sixty two after a long reign of forty three years never could nezar died
he was followed by three kings whose reins were short
and in five fifty five nebonedus the father of the biblical belshazzar came to the throne
cyrus the king of persia was rising to power and after he had defeated the middies
he extended his empire to the mediterranean and even to egypt
perhaps babylon was so strongly fortified that at first he made no attempt to add it to his empire
but when nebonadus joined with the king of egypt and with the wealthy crocess of lydia in an alliance against him
cyrus decided that babylon must be taken
in five thirty eight the city fell and for a time it became the home of the persian king
the fall of babylon with its lofty walls was a most important event in the history of the ancient world
a great empire which had existed for more than three thousand years was brought to an end
the old enemies of babylon rejoiced
when the news came to the hebrews who were held there in exile they excitedly rushed about the streets crying babylon is fallen
and to them came hope of returning to jerusalem
but how did the mighty city fall how could cyrus take babylon whose walls were strong enough to resist any army
it is a long story poets have sung it historians have written it prophets have preached it legends have gathered about it
every child knows the story of the writing of the hand on the wall
it was the night that babylon fell
belshazzar the king he was really the king's son gave a feast to a thousand of his nobles
in the great banquet hall of the palace when the guests were drinking from the golden cups and the revelry was at its highest
there suddenly appeared upon the wall an armless hand
high up where all might see it the armless hand wrote the king's fate
thou art weighed in the balances and art found wanting
in that night so the story ends belshazzar the chaldean king was slain
less picturesque than this hebrew legend is the royal record of babylon which fortunately was inscribed upon a clay cylinder from the ruins of the city
it refers to the death of the king's son possibly to belshazzar of the bible story
in the month tammuz when cyrus fought the troops of acad babylonia et opis on the river sauth sullit
he subdued the people and wherever they collected he slew them
on the fourteenth day sipar was taken without a battle
ne bonetas spled
on the sixteenth day the troops of cyrus entered babylon without a battle
nebonitus was taken prisoner in babylon
on the third of marchesvun cyrus entered babylon and proclaimed peace to all the city
he appointed gobrious governor of babylon
on the night of the eleventh day gobrius killed the son of the king
nor does the royal record of babylon contained the only contemporary account of the fall of the city
for upon a barrel shaped cylinder of clay bearing a long inscription we have cyrus's account of his capture of babylon
extracts from it are as follows
marduke the great lord
looking with joy on his pious works and upright heart
commanded him cyrus to go forth to his city babylon and he went by his side as a friend and companion
his many troops whose number like the waters of the river could not be counted marched in full armour at his side
without a skirmish or a battle he permitted them to enter babylon and sparing the city he delivered the king nebonitus to him
all the people of babylon prostrated themselves before him and kissing his feet rejoiced in his sovereignty while happiness shone on their faces
the inscription continues i am cyrus king of the world
when i made my gracious entry into babylon with exceeding joy i took up my abode in the royal palace
my many troops marched peacefully into babylon
i gave heed to the needs of babylon and its cities and the servitude of the babylonians whatever was oppressive i removed from them
i quieted their sighings and soothed their sorrows
a much longer account of the capture of babylon by cyrus appears in the writings of herodotus
though herodotus wrote nearly a hundred years after babylon fell his story seems to bear the stamp of truth
he certainly mentions details which neither nebonitus nor cyrus would care to have appear in their royal records his story is as follows
cyrus with the first approach of the ensuing spring marched forward against babylon
the babylonians encamped without their walls awaited his coming
a battle was fought at a short distance from the city in which the babylonians were defeated by the persian king
whereupon they withdrew within their defences
here they shut themselves up and made light of his siege having laid in a store of provision for many years in preparation against this attack
for when they saw cyrus conquering nation after nation they were convinced that he would never stop and their turn would come at last
cyrus was now reduced to great perplexity as time went on and he made no progress against the place
in this distress either someone made this suggestion to him or he bethought himself of a plan which he proceeded to put in execution
he placed a portion of his army at the point where the river enters the city and another body at the back of the place where it issues forth
with orders to march into the town by the bed of the stream as soon as the water became shallow enough
he then himself drew off with the unwarlike portion of his host and made for the place where nutochris dug the basin for the river
where he did exactly what she had done formerly he turned the euphrates by a canal into the basin which was then a marsh
on which the river sank to such an extent that the natural bed of the stream became foridable
hereupon the persians who had been left for the purpose at babylon by the river side
entered the stream which had now sunk so as to reach about midway up a man's thigh and thus got into the town
had the babylonians been apprized of what cyrus was about or had they noticed their danger they would never have allowed the persians to enter the city
but would have destroyed them utterly for they would have made fast all the street gates which gave upon the river
and mounting upon the walls along both sides of the stream would so have caught the enemy as it were in a track
but as it was the persians came upon them by surprise and so took the city
owing to the vast size of the place the inhabitants of the central parts as the residence of batelon declare
long after the outer portions of the town were taken knew nothing of what had chanced but as they were engaged in a festival
continued dancing and revelling until they learned the capture but too certainly
such then were the circumstances of the first taking of babylon
when cyrus took babylon little or no force was employed
only the king's son belshazzar was killed
the city was spared
the great walls were left standing
the daily sacrifices were continued in the temples and cyrus made his home in the royal palace
the people enjoying the greater freedom which cyrus permitted them were contented and life in babylon went on about as before
in five twenty nine cyrus died
during the reigns of the two following persian kings babylon was slowly regaining its independence
and in five twenty one never could nezar the third a native babylonian was placed on the throne
then the babylonians secretly plotted to throw off the persian yoke
that same year when darius histespis came to the persian throne the babylonians openly rebelled
the following story from herodotus tells the results
at last when the time came for rebelling openly they did as follows
having first set apart their mothers each man chose besides out of his whole household one woman whomsoever he pleased
these alone were allowed to live while all the rest were brought to one place and strangled
the women chosen were kept to make bread for the men while the others were strangled that they might not consume the stores
when tidings reached darious of what had happened
he drew together all his power and began the war by marching straight upon babylon and laying siege to the place
the babylonians however cared not a whit for his siege
mounting upon the battlements that crowned their walls they insulted and jeered at darius and his mighty host
one even shouted to them and said why sit ye there persians why do ye not go back to your homes till mules full you will not take our city
this was said by a babylonian who thought that a mule would never fall
now when a year and seven months had passed darius and his army were quite wearied out finding that they could not anyhow take the city
all stratagems and all arts had been used and yet the king could not prevail
not even when he tried the means by which cyrus had made himself master of the place
the babylonians were ever upon the watch and he found no way of conquering them
at last in the twentieth month
a marvellous thing happened to zopirus son of the megabizeus who was among the seven men that overthrew the magoose
one of his sumter mules gave birth to a fall
zopirus when they told him not thinking that it could be true went and saw the colt with his own eyes
after which he commanded his servants to tell no one what had come to pass while he himself pondered the matter
calling to mind than the words of the babylonian at the beginning of the siege
till mules fold ye shall not take our city he thought as he reflected on this speech that babylon might now be taken
for it seemed to him that there was a divine providence in the man having used the phrase and then his mule having fold
as soon therefore as he felt within himself that babylon was fated to be taken he went to darius and asked him if he set a very high value on its conquest
when he found that darius did indeed value it highly he considered further with himself how he might make the deed his own and be the man to take babylon
noble exploits in persia are ever highly honored and bring their authors to greatness
he therefore reviewed always of bringing the city under
but found none by which he could hope to prevail unless he maimed himself and then went over to the enemy
to do this seeming to him a like matter he mutilated himself in a way that was utterly without remedy
for he cut off his own nose and ears and then clipping his hair close and flogging himself with a scourge
he came in this plight before darius
wrath stirred within the king at the sight of a man of his lofty rank in such a condition
leaping down from his throne he exclaimed aloud and asked the piras who it was that had disfigured him and what he had done to be so treated
zapyrus answered there is not a man in the world but thou o king that could reduce me to such a plight
no stranger's hands have rought this work on me but my own only
i maimed myself because i could not endure that the assyrians should laugh at the persians wretched man said darius
thou coverest the foulest deeds with the fairest possible name when thou sayest thy maiming is to help our siege forward
how will thy disfigurement thou simpleton induced the enemy to yield one day sooner
surely thou hadst gone out of thy mind when thou didst so misuse thyself
had i told thee rejoined the other what i was bent on doing thou wouldst not have suffered it
as it is i kept my own counsel and so accomplished my plans
now therefore if there be no failure on thy part we shall take babylon
i will desert to the enemy as i am and when i get into their city i will tell them that it is by thee that i have been thus treated
i think they will believe my words and entrust me with a command of troops thou on thy part must wait
till the tenth day after i am entered within the town and then placed near to the gates of semi ramas a detachment of thy army
troops for whose loss thou wilt care little a thousand men
wait after that seven days and post me another detachment two thousand strong at the ninavigates
then let twenty days pass and at the end of that time stationed near the childean gates a body of four thousand
let neither these nor the former troops be armed with any weapons but their swords those thou mayst leave them
after the twenty days are over bid thy whole army attack the city on every side and put me two bodies of persians
one at the bellion the other at the sissian gates for i expect that on account of my successes
the babylonians will entrust everything even the keys of their gates to me then it will be for me and my persians to do the rest
having left these instructions so pyrus fled towards the gates of the town often looking back to give himself the air of a deserter
the men upon the towers whose business it was to keep a lookout
observing him hastened down and setting one of the gates slightly ajar questioned him who he was and on what errand he had come
he replied that he was sapiras and deserted to them from the persians
then the doorkeepers when they heard this carried him at once before the magistrates
introduced into their assembly he began to bewail his misfortunes telling them that
darius had nawtreated him in the way they could see only because he had given advice that the siege should be raised since there seemed no hope of taking the city
and now he went on to say my coming to you babylonians
will prove the greatest game that you could possibly receive while to darius and the persians it will be the severest loss
verily he by whom i have been so mutilated shall not escape unpunished and truly all the paths of his counsels are known to me
thus did thopirates speak
the babylonians seeing a persian of such exalted rank in so grievous a plight his nose and ears cut off
his body red with marks of scourging and with blood had no suspicion but that he spoke the truth and was really come to be their friend and helper
they were ready therefore to grant him anything he asked
and on his suing for a command they intrusted to him a body of troops with the help of which he proceeded to do as he had arranged with darious
on the tenth day after his flight he led out his detachment and surrounding the thousand men
whom darius according to agreement had sent first he fell upon them and slew them all
then the babylonians seeing that his deeds were as brave as his words were beyond measure pleased and set no bounds to their trust
and when the next period agreed on had elapsed again with a band of picked men he sallied forth and slaughtered the two thousand
after this second exploit his praise was in all mouths
once more however he waited till the interval appointed had gone by and then leading the troops to the place where the four thousand were
he put them also to the sword
this last victory gave him the finishing stroke to his power and made him all in all with the babylonians
accordingly they committed to him the command of their whole army and put the keys of their city into his hands
darius now still keeping to the plan agreed upon
attacked the walls on every side whereupon zoparus played out the remainder of his stratagem
while the babylonians crowding to the walls did their best to resist the persian assault
he threw open the scissian and bellian gates and admitted the enemy
such of the babylonians as witnessed the treachery took refuge in the temple of jupiter bellis
the rest who did not see it kept at their posts till at last they too learned that they were betrayed
thus was babylon taken for the second time
darius having become master of the place destroyed the wall and tore down all the gates
for cyrus had done neither the one nor the other when he took babylon
he then chose out near three thousand of the leading citizens and caused them to be crucified while he allowed the remainder still to inhabit the city
further wishing to prevent the race of the babylonians from becoming extinct
he provided wives for them in the room of those whom as i explained before they strangled to save their stores
these he levied from the nations bordering on babylonia
who were each required to send so large a number to babylon that in all there were collected no fewer than fifty thousand
it is from these women that the babylonians of our times are sprung
as for zapyrus he was considered by darius to have surpassed in the greatness of his achievements all other persians
whether a former or of later times except only cyrus with whom no person ever yet thought himself worthy to compare
darius as the story goes would often say that he had rather as a piraes were unmaimed than be master of twenty more babylons
and he honoured thapiraes greatly
year by year he presented him with all the gifts which are held in most esteem among the persians
he gave him likewise the government of babylon for his life
free from tribute
and he also granted him many other favors
how much truth there may be in this interesting tale of herodotus we may never know
yet we may be sure that babylon was taken by darius only by use of stratagem its walls were impregnable
cyrus had permitted them to stand and as long as he made babylon his home the city was as strongly protected as ever
darius who besieged the rebellious city twice weakened it by destroying some of its walls
during the reign of zerces again the city rebelled and in four eighty four b c he captured it and completely demolished its defences
yet babylon continued to live
for history mentions the names of two of its later rulers
the palace hav never could nezer was occupied by alexander the great
and there on june thirteenth three twenty three b c he met his death
the city then fell to seleucus
one of alexander's generals who for a time made it his home but he was a greek and cared little for things babylonian
therefore to destroy the power of the old capital he planned to build silucia on the tigris about fifty miles to the east
the priests of the temple of bell so a story tells us
learned of his purpose and when they were consulted as to the most favorable time for beginning to work upon the new city
they intentionally mentioned a most unfavorable hour
the priest's deception was unavailing and in two seventy five b c the inhabitants of babylon were transported to sileucia
then the world metropolis stripped of most of its population became a mere village
the poor of the surrounding country occupied its dismantled palaces
the hebrew exiles whose ancestors never could nezar had brought from jerusalem
settled there and finally the place was abandoned to the arabs of the desert
slowly the few remaining walls fell and were buried in their own ruins
as the centuries passed the mounds into which the city had turned grew higher and higher with the ruins of the huts later built upon them
until at last the foundations of the temples and palaces were buried fully a hundred feet beneath the surface
even the shepherds ceased to graze their sheep there and the wandering arabs
fearing the wild beasts and evil spirits which lurk among all old ruins refused to pitch their tents there
the prophecy of the hebrew isaiah was fulfilled
wild beasts of the desert shall lie there
and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures and owls shall dwell there and setters shall dance there
and the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses and dragons in their pleasant palaces
so babylon was buried and forgotten
it had become as deo cassius said
mounds and legends and ruins
but the walls of the old city had not yet served their full purpose
the sicanian kings of persia were fond of hunting and babylon then overgrown with trees was their game preserve
the old walls were restored to a height sufficient to prevent the escape of the animals and among the ruins the kings enjoyed their favorite sport
saint jerome said
i was informed by a certain elamite brother who came from those regions and now leads the life of a monk at jerusalem
that there is a royal hunting ground at babylon and that wild game of every kind is contained within the circuit of its walls
the statement of saint jerome is confirmed by the following passage
from zossimas a greek writer of the fifth century a d
as the emperor julian was marching forward through babylonia
he passed other unimportant fortresses and came at last to a walled enclosure
which the natives pointed out as a royal hunting ground
it was a low rampart enclosing a wide space planted with trees of every sort in which all kinds of beasts were shut up
they were supplied with food by keepers and gave the king the opportunity of hunting whenever he felt inclined
when julian saw this he caused a large part of the wall to be overthrown and as the beasts escaped they were shot down by his soldiers
the walls of babylon were destined to serve still another purpose
the spread of mohammedanism caused new cities to be built and babylon was the quarry for their building material
the walls of babylon were transformed into the sacred cities of crebella and nejeffe
in the eleventh century on the site of the southern part of babylon the city of hella was built
hella might be called a child of babylon for it is almost entirely constructed with nevicate nezzars bricks
the walls of the houses are built up them
the courtyards and streets are paved with them
and as you walk about the city the name of never kid nezzar everywhere meets your eye
many of the ten thousand people living in hilla still gain their livelihood by digging the bricks from the ruins to sell to the modern builders
the great irrigating dams across the euphrates are constructed entirely of them
the people of hilla too are a survival of babylonian times
some are arabs of the same tribes which used to roam the desert and never could nezzars days some are the children of the hebrew exiles of old
some calling themselves christians are the descendants of babylonians perhaps if never could nezure himself
there among the ruins they still live in the same kind of houses
dressing the same eating the same food as did their ancestors we never could nezzar built the walls of babylon
among the first of the modern travellers to describe the ruins of babylon was anthony shirley an englishman who visited mesopotamia in fifteen ninety nine
in his quaint way he says
all the ground on which babylon was spread is left now desolate nothing standing in that peninsula between the euphrates and the tigris
but only part and that a small part of the great tower which god hath suffered to stand
if man may speak so confidently of his great impenetrable counsels for an eternal testimony of his great work in the confusion of man's pride
and that arc of never could nezare for as perpetual a memory of his great idolatry and condigne punishment
about that same time pietro de la vallet an italian visited babylon
and digging from the wall and inscribed square brick bearing the name of neverkid nezzer he took it to rome where it may still be seen
that was the first object taken from babylon to europe
it was the beginning of the great collections of babylonian antiquities and the museums of the western world
among the later visitors to babylon was the great kneebore
in eighteen twelve james claudius rich the british resident at bagdad made the first complete examination of the ruins
porter layard and rowlinson followed him
but the real scientific exploration of babylon and its walls
was begun by the doicier oureat gasselshaft in eighteen eighty nine and continued till the summer of nineteen fifteen
for fifteen years doctor colduie and his assistants with a force of two hundred native workmen have labored there winter and summer
the enormous amount of debris which buried the palaces and temples and walls of nevekadnezzars city in places to the depth of a hundred feet
has been removed and the surrounding city walls have been traced
the excavations have shown that babylon as the ancients told us was nearly square
the euphrates flowed through it but the greater part of the city was on the eastern shore
the city walls of which the ancients were so proud appear here and there like low ridges far out on the plain
other parts of them have disappeared entirely
in the northern part of the enclosure to the east of the river
the large high mound which resembles a mountain from a distance still bears the ancient name babbel
arabs searching for bricks have burrowed their way down deep into it revealing massive walls and arches
the germans maintain that it is the ruin of the tower of battle
here it has been suggested were the famous hanging gardens which some ancient author is included among the seven wonders of the world
however it is possible that the hanging gardens existed only in the imagination of the greek writers
for none of the many buildings inscriptions from neverkad nezar mentions them
possibly along the terraces of the walls or upon the stages of some lofty temple tower
trees and overhanging vines were planted and thus the traveller's tales arose
at a distance of about two miles to the south of babel is the larger and lower mound called a custr or the fortress
because great masses of masonry used to project from its surface
deep down in the bound the germans discovered the palace of nebukat nezar with its hundreds of small chambers and huge surrounding walls
the mound still farther south is called omran because upon its summit stands the tomb of a mohammedan saint of that name
there lie the ruins of the famous temple of essigile sacred to marduke
upon the little mound joomed juma farther on an arab village has long stood
all of the ancient writers agree
in saying that babylon was surrounded with both inner and outer walls and the ruins confirmed their statements
parts of the walls of nineveh are still standing to the height of one hundred and twenty five feet
but the walls of babylon have so long been used to supply bricks to the builders of the neighboring cities that only their bases remain
in places even the bases have disappeared and their moats have long been filled with the drifting sand
the outer wall bore the name of nimity bell its direction was northeast and southwest forming a triangle with the river
the northeastern section may now be traced for a distance of less than three miles and the southwestern for more than a mile
but both sections originally reached the river
it seems that the circuit of the outer wall was about eleven miles
the small portions of it which have been excavated suffice to show its construction
the moat ten feet deep and of a width no longer known ran close to its base the wall was double
its outer part was about twenty four feet in thickness and its foundations as never could nezzs or said were carried down to the water level
its bricks measuring about thirteen inches square and three inches in thickness were burned and stamped
with the usual short inscription
nebukidnezar king of babylon the restorer of the temples e sagle at ezita
the first born sun of nabo polassar king of babylon
they were laid in bitumed
the inner part of the wall was constructed of unburned bricks and at a distance of about thirty six feet from the outer part
the intervening space which was filled with dirt probably to the upper inner edge of the outer part
served as an elevated road where several chariots might have been driven abreast
this inner part was about twenty four feet wide and at intervals of about one hundred and forty feet it was surmounted with towers
the entire width of the outer defence not including the moat was therefore about eighty two feet
its height was probably more than double its width but that may never be determined
the inner wall of babylon was called imgurbelle and like the outer wall it was double
time has dealt even less kindly with it for it may be traced only for the distance of about a mile along its eastern side
never could nezzar says that he built it of burned bricks but only sun dried bricks laid in mud now appear
its outer part about twelve feet in width was protected with towers at intervals of sixty five feet
a space of about twenty three feet separated it from its inner part which was about twenty feet in width
it too was surmounted with towers
no traces of its mote have appeared
the entire width of this inner defence was about fifty five feet its height is uncertain
to protect the sundried bricks of the inner wall from the winter rains
there were drains of large burned bricks some of which bore the following long inscription
nebouchad nezzer king of babylon
the exalted prince the protector of isago and izita son of nabopolassar king of babylon am i
nabo polussar the father my begetter built imgar bell the great wall of babylon
but i the devout petitioner the worshipper of the gods built the moat and made its wall of burned brick and bitumen mountain high
oh marduk great god looked joyfully upon the precious work of my hands be thou my protector
grant me as a gift a life of distant days
the outer and inner defences of babylon were so strong and so high that no enemy could hope to take them
yet the palace of nebukidnezzar was protected by a third defence far stronger
fortunately its walls have suffered less from the hands of the brick hunters and the german excavators have been able to reconstructo their plan
they may best be described by means of the accompanying diagram representing a cross section
ad the enemy of babylon succeeded in breaking through the outer and inner defenses of the city the royal palace would have still been far from his reach
he would have had to cross a deep moat to scale a wall of burned bricks about twenty feet in thickness and perhaps three times as high
then a second wall still higher
a third and fourth
and a fifth each stronger and higher than the others
and surmounted with towers and then finally a sixth wall
whose summit reached into the sky as far perhaps as the tallest of the modern buildings
between the several sections were wide spaces where foot soldiers and charioteers might fight
it must have been an imposing sight to one standing without to have seen the walls one after another
rising higher and higher like a great terraced turreted mountain
we do not know their height for the statements of the ancient writers disagree
parodatist says that it was three hundred and thirty five feet
cesius mentions three hundred feet probably they were not far from the truth
the ruins reached the height of about forty feet
nor were the walls about the palace a great mass of dull brick masonry
the ishtard gateway leading to the palace was encased with beautiful blue glazed bricks
and decorated here and there with large reliefs representing bulls and lions and dragons
designed in colors of white and blue and yellow and black
it seems that the bricks of the reliefs were moulded and glazed separately and so accurately that when built into the wall they fitted perfectly
a modern artist would have difficulty in doing such accurate work
some of these decorations the most valuable objects found in the ruins of the great city still remain in their places on the walls
others have been taken to the berylin museum
nebecadnezzer speaks of great bronze gates and of images of bronze but none have been discovered
probably their metal was far too valuable for the enemy to leave behind
should you walk along the shore of the euphrates at babylon you would still see the embankments which never could nezer construct it of bricks bearing his name
but the river walls have disappeared and the buttresses of the bridges have been torn or washed away
should you cross the river to search for the western inner wall you would find but a small fragment of it
the great outer wall seems to have disappeared completely beneath the desert surface
such were the walls of babylon
the strongest the thickest the loftiest the most intricate perhaps the most beautiful that ever protected a city
walls which no ancient army was ever able to take my storm
it is not strange then that they were included among the seven wonders of the world
or that the babylonian soldier stood confidently upon their summit and jeering at the persian army encamped below shouted
report of the president's commission on the assassination of president kennedy the warren commission report by the president's commission on the assassination of president kennedy
chapter two the assassination part one
this chapter describes president kennedy's trip to dalis from its origin through its tragic conclusion
the narrative of these events is based largely on the recollections of the participants
although in many instances documentary or other evidence has also been used by the commission
beginning with the advanced plans and secret service preparations for the trip
this chapter reviews the motor cade through dalis the fleeting moments of the assassination
the activities at parkland memorial hospital and the return of the presidential party to washington
and a valuation of the procedures employed to safeguard the president with recommendations for improving these procedures appears in chapter eight of the report
planning the texas trip
president kennedy's visit to texas in november nineteen sixty three had been under consideration for almost a year before it occurred
he had made only a few brief visits to the state since the nineteen sixty presidential campaign
and in nineteen sixty two he began to consider a formal visit
during nineteen sixty three the reasons for making the trip became more persuasive
as a political leader the president wished to resolve the factional controversy within the democratic party in texas before the election of nineteen sixty four
the party itself saw an opportunity to raise funds by having the president speak at a political dinner eventually planned for austin
as chief of state the president always welcomed the opportunity to learn first hand about the problems which concerned the american people
moreover he looked forward to the public appearances which he personally enjoyed
the basic decision on the november trip to texas was made at a meeting of president kennedy
vice president johnson and governor connolly on june fifth nineteen sixty three at the cortes hotel in elpasor texas
the president had spoken earlier that day at the eir force academy and colorado springs colorado
and had stopped o el paso to discuss the proposed visit and other matters with the vice president and the governor
the three agreed that the president would come to texas in late november nineteen sixty three
the original plan called for the president to spend only one day in the state making whirlwind visits to dalis fortworth san antonio and houston
in september the white house decided to permit further visits by the president and extended the trip to run from the afternoon of november twenty one
through the evening of friday november twenty two
when governor connolly called at the white house on october fourth to discuss the details of the visit
it was agreed that the planning of events in texas would be left largely to the governor
at the white house kenneth o'donnell special assistant to the president acted as co ordinator for the trip
everyone agreed that if there was sufficient time a motor cate through downtown daliss would be the best way for the people to see their president
when the trip was planned for only one day governor connolly had opposed the motor caye because there was not enough time the governor stated however that quote
once we got san antonio moved from friday to thursday afternoon where that was his initial stop in texas
then we had the time and i withdrew my objections to a motor cae and quote
according to o'donnell quot we had a motor cade wherever we went and quote
particularly in large cities where the purpose was to let the president be seen by as many people as possible
in his experience quote it would be automatic and quote for the secret service to arrange a route which would within the time allotted
bring the president quote through an area which exposes him to the greatest number of people and quote
advance preparations for the taolist trip
advance preparations for president kennedy's visit to dalis were primarily the responsibility of two secret service agents
special agent wincston g lawson a member of the white house detail who acted as the advance agent and forest vi sorrels
special agent in charge of the dalliss office both agents were advised of the trip on november fourth
lost and received a tentative schedule of the texas trip on november eighth from roy h kellerman assisted special agent in charge of the white house detail
who was the secret service official responsible for the entire texas journey
as advance agent working closely with sorrels lost and had responsibility for arranging the time table for the president's visit to dalis
and co ordinating local activities with the white house staff the organizations directly concerned with the visit and local law enforcement officials
lost's most important responsibilities were to take preventive action against any one indowlus considered a threat to the president
to select the lunche on sight an motor caye rout and to plan security measures for the luncheon and the motor k
preventive intelligence activities the protective research section p r s of the secret service
maintains records of people who have threatened the president or so conducted themselves as to be deemed a potential danger to him
on november eighth nineteen sixty three
after undertaking the responsibility for advance preparations for the visit to dalis agent lawson went to the piaras offices in washington
a check of the geographic indices there revealed no listing for any individual deemed to be a potential danger to the president
in the territory of the secret service regional office which includes jalice and fortworth
to supplement the piress philes the secret service depends largely on local police departments and local offices of other federal agencies
which advise it of potential threats immediately before the visit of the president to their community
upon his arrival in dalis on november twelfth
lost and conferred with the local police and the local office of the federal bureau of investigation about potential dangers to the president
although there was no mention in piress spiles of the demonstration endouwbtless against ambassador adelaide stevenson on october twenty fourth
nineteen sixty three lawson inquired about the incident and obtained through the local police photographs of some of the persons involved
on november twenty two a secret service agent stood at the entrance to the trade mark where the president was scheduled to speak wite copies of these photographs
dallass detectives in the lobby of the trade mart and in the luncheon area also had copies of these photographs
a number of people who resembled some of those in the photographs were placed under surveillance at the trade mart
the f be i office in dalice gave the local secret service representatives the name of a possibly dangerous individual in the dallast area who was investigated
it also advised the secret service of the circulation on november twenty one of a handbill sharply critical of president kennedy
discussed in chapter six of this report
shortly before the dalliss police had reported to his secret service that the handbill had appeared on the streets of jalic
neither the dallist police nor the f be i had yet learned the source of the handbill
no one else was identified to the secret service through local inquiry as potentially dangerous
nor did piares develop any additional information between november twelfth when lawsan left washington and november twenty two
the adequacy of the intelligent system maintained by the secret service at the time of the assassination
including a detailed description of the available data on lee harvey oswald and the reasons why his name had not been furnished to the secret service
is discussed in chapter eight
an important purpose of the president's visit to dalice was to speak at a luncheon given by business and civic leaders
the white house staff informed the secret service
that the president would arrive and depart from dalis's love field that a motor cade through the downtown area of dalis to the luncheon sihte should be arranged
and that following the luncheon the president would return to the airport by the most direct route
accordingly it was important to determine the luncheon sight as quickly as possible so that security could be established at the sight and the motor cayed rout selected
on november fourth gerald a ben agent in charge of the white house detail asked sorrels to examine three potential sites for the luncheon
one building market hall was unavailable for november twenty two
the second the women's building at the state fair grounds
was a one story building with few entrances and easy to make secure but it lacked necessary food handling facilities
and had certain unattractive features including a low ceiling with exposed conduits and beams
the third possibility the trade marked a handsome new building with all the necessary facilities presented security problems it had numerous entrances
several tiers of balconies surrounding the central court where the luncheon would be held and several catwalks crossing the court at each level
on november fourth
sorrows told ben he believed security difficulties that the trade mark could be overcome by special precautions
lawson also evaluated the security hazards at the trade mark on november thirteenth
kenneth o'donnell made the final decision to hold the luncheon at the trade march
then so notified lawson on november fourteenth
once the trade mart had been selected
sorrows and loss and worked out detailed arrangements for security at the building
in addition to the preventive measures already mentioned they provided for controlling access to the building closing off and policing areas around it
securing the roof and insuring the presence of numerous police officers inside and around the building
ultimately more than two hundred law enforcement officers mainly doubtless police but including eight secret service agents
were deployed in and around the trade mark
the motor cave rout
on november eighth when lawson was breathed on the itinerary for the trip to dalis
he was told that forty five minutes had been allotted for a motor cate procession from love field to the luncheon site
lawson was not specifically instructed to select the parade route but he understood that this was one of his functions
even before the trade mark had been definitely selected losson and sorrols began to consider the best motor cade rout from love field to the trade mark
on november fourteenth lawson and sorrews attended a meeting at love field
and on their return to dalis drove over the route which sorrels believed best suited for the proposed motor cay
this route eventually selected for the motor cade from the airport to the trade mark measured ten miles and could be driven easily within the allotted forty five minutes
from love field the route passed through a portion of suburban dallis
through the downtown area along main street and then to the trade mark via stemons freeway
for the president's return to love field following the luncheon the agents selected the most direct route which was approximately four miles
after the selection of the trade mark as the luncheon sight
lawson and sorrels met with dawlliss chief of police jesse e curry assistant chief charles bachelor
deputy chief and t fisher and several other command officers to discuss details of the motor cade and possible routs
the route was further reviewed by lawson and sorrows with assistant chief bachelor and members of the local host committee on november fifteenth
the police officials agreed that the route recommended by sorrels was the proper one and did not express a belief that any other route might be better
on november eighteenth
sorrows and loss and drove over the selected route with bachelor and other police officers verifying that it could be traversed within forty five minutes
representatives of the local host committee in the white house staff were advised by the secret service of the actual route on the afternoon of november eighteenth
the route impressed the agents as a natural and desirable one
sorrels who had participated in presidential protection assignments en dows since a visit by president franklin d roosevelt
in nineteen thirty six as testified that the traditional parade route in dallis was along main street since the tall buildings along the street
gave more people an opportunity to participate
the route chosen from the airport to main street was the normal one except where harwood street was selected as the means of access to main street
in preference to a short stretch of the central express way which presented a minor safety hazard
and could not accommodate spectators as conveniently as harwood street
according to lawson the chosen route seemed to be the best
it afforded us wide streets most of the way because of the buses that were in the motor cane
it afforded us a chance to have alternative routes if something happened on the motor cade rout it was the type of suburban area a good part of the way
where the crowds would be able to be controlled for a great distance and we figured that the largest crowds would be downtown which they were
and that the wide streets that we would use downtown would be of sufficient width to keep the public out of our way
elm street parallel to main street and one block north
was not used for the main portion of the downtown part of the motor cade because main street offered better vantage points for spectators
to reach the trade mark from main street the agents decided to use the stemen's free way route number seventy seven the most direct route
the only practical way for west bound traffic on main street
to reach the north bound lanes of the stemon's free way is vhea elm street which route number seventy seven traffic is instructed to follow in this part of the city
elm street was to be reached from maine by turning right at heuston
going one block north and then turning left onto elm
on this last portion of the journey only five minutes from the trade mark
the president's motor caid would pass the texas schoolbook depository building on the northwest corner of houston and elm street
the building overlooks deily plauza and attractively landscaped triangle of three acres
from houston street which forms the base of the triangle three streets commerce maine and elm
trisect the plaza converging at the apex of the triangle to form a triple underpasth beneath a multiple railroad bridge
almost five hundred feet from heuston street
elm street the northernmost of the three after intersecting houston curves in a southwesterly ark
through the under passh and leads into an axis road
which branches off to the right and is used by traffic going to the stemons freeway and the dallist fortworth turnpike
the elm street approach to the stemon's free way is necessary
in order to avoid the traffic hazards which would otherwise exist if right turns were permitted from both maine and elm into the freeway
to create this traffic pattern a concrete barrier between main and elm streets presents an obstacle to a right turn
from maine a cross elm to the axis road to stemen's free way and the dallis fortworth turnpike
this concrete barrier extends far enough beyond the access road to make it impracticable for vehicles to term right from maine directly to the axcess road
a sign located on this barrier instructs main street traffic not to make any terms
in conformity with these arrangements traffic proceeding west on main is directed to turn right at heuston
in order to reach the dallis fortworth turnpike which has the same access roade from elm street as does the stemons free way
the planning for the motor cade also included advance preparations for security arrangements along the route
sorrows and lawson reviewed the route in co operation with assistant chief bachelor and other dobless police officials who took notes on the requirements
for controlling the crowds in traffic watching the over passes and providing motorcycle escort
to control traffic arrangements were made for the deployment of foot patrolment and motorcycle police at various positions along the route
police were assigned to each overpass on the route and instructed to keep them clear of unauthorized persons
no arrangements were made for police or building custodians
to inspect buildings along the motor cave rout since the secret service did not normally request or make such a check
understandard procedures the responsibility for watching the windows of buildings was shared by local police stationed along the route
and secret service agents riding in the motor caye
as the date for the president's visit approached
the two dallast newspapers carried several reports of his motor caye rout
the selection of the trade mark as the possible sight for the luncheon first appeared in the dallest times harold on november fifteenth nineteen sixty three
the following day the newspaper reported that the presidential party

also on november nineteenth
the morning news reported that the president's motor caide would travel from love field along specified streets then

on the morning of the president's arrival
the morning news noted that their motor cate would travel through downtown dalice on to the stemon's free way and reported that quote the motor cade will move slowly
so that crowds can get a good view of president kennedy and his wife
doubtless before the visit
the president's intention to pay a visit to texas in the full of nineteen sixty three aroused interest throughout the state
the two dallast newspapers provided their readers with a steady stream of information and speculation about the trip
beginning on september thirteenth when the times harold announced in a front page article
that president kennedy was planning a brief one day tour of four texas cities
dalus fortworth san antonio and heuston
both daolast papers sighted white house sources on september twenty sixth as confirming the president's intention to visit texas on november twenty one and twenty two
with jallous scheduled as one of the stops
articles editorials and letters to the editor in the dallis morning news and the dallest times harold after september thirteenth
reflected the feeling in the community toward the forthcoming presidential visit
although there were critical editorials and letters to the editors the new stories reflected the desire of dalis officials to welcome the president with dignity and courtesy
an editorial in the times herald of september seventeenth
called on the people of dawlis to be congenial hosts even though dalise didn't vote for mister kennedy in nineteen sixty
may not indorse him in sixty four
on october three the dalless morning news quoted u s representative joe pool's hope
that president kennedy would receive a good welcome and would not face demonstrations like those encountered
by vice president johnson during the nineteen sixty campaign
increased concern about the president's visit was aroused by the incident involving the u s ambassador to the united nations adelaide e stevenson
on the evening of october twenty fourth nineteen sixty three after addressing a meeting in dawis
stevenson was jeered jostled and spat upon by hostile demonstrations outside the dallas memorial auditorium theatre
the local national and international reaction to this incident evoked from dallis officials and newspapers strong condemnations of the demonstrators
mayor earl cabelle called on the city to redeem itself during president kennedy's visit
he asserted that dalice had shed its reputation of the twenties as the quote southwest hate capital of dixie and quote
on october twenty sixth the press reported chief of police curry's plans
to call in one hundred extra off duty officers to help protect president kennedy
any thought that the president might counsel his visit to dalis was ended
when governor connolly confirmed on november eighth that the president would come to texas on november twenty one and twenty two
and that he would visit san antonio houston fortworth dalus and austin
during november the dallist papers were ported frequently on the plans for protecting the president stressing the thoroughness of the preparations
they conveyed the please of dawless leaders that citizens not demonstrate or create disturbances during the president's visit
on november eighteenth the daolist city council adopted a new city ordinance prohibiting interference with attendants at lawful assemblies
two days before the president's arrival chief curry warned that the dallisst police would not permit improper conduct during the president's visit
meanwhile on november seventeenth
the president of the dallst chamber of commerce referred to the city's reputation for being the friendliest town in america and asserted that citizens would quote
greet the president of the united states with the warmth and pride that keep the dallist spirit famous the world over and quote
two days later a local republican leader called for civilized non partisan welcome
for president kennedy stating that in many respects dallass county has isolated itself from the main stream of life in the world in this decade
another reaction to the impending visit hostile to the president came to a head shortly before his arrival
on november twenty one there appeared on the streets of dalis the anonymous handbill mentioned above
it was fashioned after the wonted circulars issued by law enforcement agencies
beneath two photographs of president kennedy one full face and one profile appeared the caption quote wanted for treason
and quote
followed by a scurilous bill of particulars that constituted a villification of the president
and on the morning of the president's arrival there appeared in the morning news a full black bordered advertisement hated
welcome mister kennedy to dalis sponsered by the american fact finding committee which the sponsor later testified was an adhack committee
but formed strictly for the purpose of having a name to put in the paper and quote

according to o'donnell the president commented that quote
if anybody really wanted to shoot the president of the united states it was not a very difficult job
all one had to do was get a high building some day with a telescopic rifle and there was nothing anybody could do to defend against such an attempt
upon concluding the conversation the president prepared to depart for daois
arrival at love field
in doubtless the rain had stopped and by midmorning a gloomy overcast sky had given way to the bright sunshine that greeted the presidential party
whene'er force one touched down at love field at eleven forty a m eastern standard time
governor and missus connolly and senator ralph w yarborough had come with the president from fort worth
vice president johnson's aerplane ere forced too had arrived at love field at approximately eleven thirty five a m
and the vice president and missus johnson were in the receiving line to greet president and missus kennedy
after a welcome from the daulless reception committee
president and missus kennedy walked along a chain link fence at the reception area greeting a large crowd of spectators that had gathered behind it
secret service agents formed a cordon to keep the press and photographers from impeding their passage and scanned the crowd for threatening movements
dalliss police stood at intervals along the fence and dalliss plain clothes men mixed in the crowd
vice president and missus johnson followed along the fence guarded by four members of the vice presidential detail
approximately ten minutes after the arrival at love field the president and missus kennedy went to the presidential automobile
to begin the motor cate
organization of the motor ca
secret service arrangements for presidential trips which were followed in the dallest motor caide
are designed to provide protection while permitting large numbers of people to see the president
every effort is made to prevent unscheduled stops although the president may and in dowice did order stops in order to greet the public
when the motor cade slows or stops agents take positions between the president and the crowd
the order of vehicles and the dallest motor cade was as follows
motorcycles dalliss police motorcycles preceded the pilot car
manned by officers of the dallist police department this automobile preceded the main party by approximately quarter of a mile
its function was to alert police along the route that the motor cabe was approaching and to check for signs of trouble
motorcycles next came four to six motorcycle policeman whose main purpose was to keep the crowd back
the lead car described as a rolling command car this was an unmarked dalless police car driven by chief of police curry
and occupied by secret service agents sorrels and lawson and by dala's county sheriff j e decker
the occupants scanned the crowd and the buildings along the route
their main function was to spot trouble in advance and to direct any necessary steps to meet the trouble
following normal practice the lead automobile stayed approximately four to five carlength ahead of the president's limousine
the presidential limousine
the president's automobile was specially designed nineteen sixty one link oln convertible
with two collapsible jump seads between the front and rear seats
it was outfitted with a clear plastic bubble top which was neither bullet proof nor bullet resistant
because the skies had cleared in dowless lost and directed that the top not be used for the day's activities
he acted on instructions he had received earlier from assistant special agent in charge roy h kellerman who was in fortworth with the president
kellerman had discussed the matter with o donnell whose instructions were quote
if the weather is clear and it is not raining have that bubble top off and quote
elevated approximately fifteen inches above the back of the front seat
was a metallic frame with four hand holds that riders in the car could grip while standing in the rear seat during parades
at the rear on each side of the automobile were small running boards each designed to hold a secret service agent
with a metallic handle for the rider to grasp
the president had frequently stated that he did not want agents to ride on these steps during a motor cate except when necessary
he had repeated this wish only a few days before during his visit to tampa florida
president kennedy rode on the right hand side of the rear seat with missus kennedy on his left
governor connolly occupied the right jump seat missus connolly the left
driving the presidential limousine with special agent william r riar of the secret service
on his right set kellerman
kellerman's responsibilities included maintaining radio communications with the lead and follow up cars
scanning the route and getting out and standing near the president when the cars stopped
motorcycles four motorcycles two on each side flanked the rear of the presidential car
they provided some cover for the president but their main purpose was to keep back the crowd
on previous occasions the president had requested that to the extent possible these flanking motorcycles keep back from the sides of his car
presidential follow up car
this vehicle on nineteen fifty five catalac eight passenger convertible especially outfitted for the secret service
followed closely behind the president's automobile
it carried eight secret service agents two in the front seat two in the rear and two on each of the right and left running boards
each agent carried a thirty eight calibere pistol and a shotgun and automatic rifle were also available
presidential assistance david f powers and kenneth o'donnell sat in the right and left jump seats respectively
the agents in this car under established procedure
had instructions to watch the route for signs of trouble
scanning not only the crowds but the windows and roofs of buildings over passes and crossings
they were instructed to watch particularly for throne objects sudden actions in the crowd and any movements toward the presidential car
the agents on the front of the running boards had directions to move immediately to positions just to the rear of the president and missus kennedy when the president's car slowed
to a walking pace or stopped
or when the press of the crowd made it impossible for the escort motorcycles to stay in position on the car's rear flanks
the two agents on the rear of the running boards were to advance toward the front of the president's car whenever it stopped or slowed down sufficiently for them to do so
vice presidential car
the vice presidential automobile a four door lincoln convertible obtained locally for use in the motor cade
proceeded approximately two to three car lenths behind the president's follow up car
this distance was maintained so that spectators would normally turn their gaze from the president's automobile by the time the vice president came into view
vice president johnson sat on the right hand side of the rear seat missus johnson in the centre and senator yarborough on the left
rufus w young blood special agent in charge of the vice president's detail
occupied the right hand side of the front seat and herchel jacks of the texas state highway patrol was the driver
vice presidential follow up car
driven by an officer of the dallist police department
this vehicle was occupied by three secret service agent and clift and cea garter assistant to the vice president
these agents performed for the vice president the same functions that the agents in the presidential follow up car performed for the president
remainder of motor cade
the remainder of the motor cade consisted of five cars for other dignitaries including the mayor of dalis and texas congressmen
telephone and western union vehicles a white house communications car
three cars for press photographers an official party bust for white house staff members and others and two press busses
admiral george g berkeley physician to the president
was in a car following those quote containing the local and national representatives and quote
lease car and motorcycles
a dalliss police car and several motorcycles at the rear
kept the motor cade together
and prevented unauthorized vehicles from joining the motor cane
communications in the motor cuaye
a base station at a fixed location in dawlis operated a radio network which linked together the lead car
presidential car presidential follow u car
white house communications car trade marked love field and the presidential and vice presidential aeroplanes
the vice presidential car
and vice presidential follow up car used portable sets with a separate frequency for their own carticar communication
the drive through dalis
the motor cade left love field shortly after eleven fifty a m and drove at speeds up to twenty five to thirty miles an hour
through thinly populated areas on the outskirts of dalis
at the president's direction his automobile stopped twice the first time to permit him to respond to a sign asking him to shake hands
during this brief stop agents in the front positions on the running boards of the presidential follow up car came forward and stood beside the president's car
looking out toward the crowd and special agent kellerman assumed his position next to the car
on the other occasion the president halted the motor cave to speak to a catholic nun and a group of small children
in the downtown area large crowds of spectators gave the president a tremendous reception
the crowds were so dense that special agent clinton j hill
had to leave the left front running board of the president's follow up car four times to ride on the rear of the president's limousine
several times special agent john d reddy came forward from the right front running board of the presidential follow up car
to the right side of the president's car
special agent glen a bennett once left his place inside the follow up car to help keep the crowd away from the president's car
when a teen aged boy ran toward the rear of the president's car reddy left the running board to chase the boy back into the crowd
on several occasions when the vice president's car was slowed down by the throng special agent young blood stepped out to hold the crowd back
according to plan the president's motor cay proceeded west through downtown dawlis on main street
to the intersection of houston street which marks the beginning of daly plaza
from main street the motor cave turned right and went north on heuston street passing tall buildings on the right
and headed toward the texas school book depository building
the spectators were still thickly congregated in front of the buildings which lined the east side of houston street but the crowd thinned abruptly along elm street
which curves in a southwesterly direction as it proceeds downgrade toward the triple underpas and the stemons free way
as the motor kate approached the intersection of houston and elm streets there was general gratification in the presidential party about the enthusiastic reception
valuating the political overtones kenneth o'donnell was especially pleased
because it convinced him that the average dallest resident was like other american citizens in respecting and admiring the president
missus connolly elated by the reception turned to president kennedy and said quote mister president you can't say dalis doesn't love you
and quote
the president replied that is very obvious
the assassination
at twelve thirty p m eastern standard time as the president's open limousine proceeded at approximately eleven miles per hour along elm street
toward the triple underpass shots fired from a rifle mortally wounded president kennedy and seriously injured governor connolly
one bullet passed through the president's neck
a subsequent bullet which was leeful shattered the right side of his skull
governor connolly sustained bullet wounds in his back the right side of his chest right wrist and left thigh
the exact time of the assassination was fixed by the testimony of four witnesses
special agent rufus w young blood observed that the large electric sign clock atop the texas school book depository building
showed the numerals twelve thirty as the vice presidential automobile proceeded north on houston street a few seconds before the shots were fired
just prior to the shooting
david f powers riding in the secret service follow up carr remarked to kenneth o donnell
that it was twelve thirty p m the time they were due at the trade mark
seconds after the shooting roy kellerman riding in the front seat of the presidential limousine
looked at his watch and said twelve thirty to the driver special aging greer
the dalless police radio log reflects that chief of police curry reported the shooting of the president
and issued his initial orders at twelve thirty p m
speed of the limousine
william grier operator of the presidential limousine estimated the corus speed at the time of the first shot as twelve to fifteen miles per hour
other witnesses in the motor cade estimated the speed of the president's limousine from seven to twenty two miles per hour
a more precise determination has been made from motion pictures taken on the scene by an amateur photographer abraham's he pruder
based on these films the speed of the president's automobile is computed at an average speed of eleven point two miles per hour
the car maintained this average speed over a distance of approximately one hundred eighty six feet immediately preceding the shot which struck the president in the head
while the car travelled this distance these a pruder camera ran one hundred fifty two frames
since the camera operates at a speed of eighteen point three frames per second
it was calculated that the car required eight point three seconds to cover the one hundred thirty six feet
this represents a speed of eleven point two miles per hour
in the presidential limousine
missus john f kennedy on the left of the rear seat of the limousine
looked toward her left and waved to the crowds along the route
soon after the motor cate turned on to elm street she heard a sound similar to a motorcycle noise and a cry from governor connolly
which caused her to look to her right
on turning she saw a quizzical look on her husband's face as he raised his left hand to his throat
missus kennedy then heard a second shot and saw the president's skull torn open under the impact of the bullet
as she cradled her mortally wounded husband missus kennedy cried quote
o my god they have shot my husband
i love you jack
governor connolly testified that he recognized the first noise as a rifle shot
and the thought immediately crossed his mind that it was an assassination attempt
from his position in the right jump seat immediately in front of the president
he instinctively turned to his right because the shot appeared to come from over his right shoulder
unable to see the president as he turned to the right
the governor started to look back over his left shoulder but he never completed the turn because he felt something strike him in the back
in his testimony before the commission
governor connolly was certain that he was hit by the second shot
which he stated he did not hear
missus connolly too heard a frightening noise from her right
looking over her right shoulder she saw that the president had both hands at his neck but she observed no blood and heard nothing
she watched as he slumped down with an empty expression on his face
roy kellerman in the right front seat of the limousine heard a report like a firecracker pop
turning to his right in the direction of the noise kellerman heard the president say
my god i am hit and saw both of the president's hands move up toward his neck
as he told the driver
quote let's get out of here we are hit and quote
kellerman grabbed his microphone and radioed ahead to the lead car

we are hit get us to the hospital immediately and quote
the driver william greer heard a noise which he took to be a back fire from one of the motorcycles flanking the presidential car
when he heard the same noise again
greer glanced over his shoulder and saw governor connolly full
at the sound of the second shot
he realized that something was wrong and he pressed down on the accelerator as kellerman said quote get out of here fast and quote
as he issued his instructions to grear add to the lead car
kellerman heard a flurry of shots within five seconds of the first noise
according to kellerman missus kennedy then cried out quote
what are they doing to you
and quote
looking back from the front seat
kellerman saw governor connolly in his wife's lap
and special agent clinton j hill lying across the trunk of the car
missus connolly heard a second shot fired and pulled her husband down into her lap
observing his blood covered chest as he was pulled into his wife's lap governor connolly believed himself mortally wounded
he cried out quote
oh no no no my god they are going to kill us all
and quote
at first missus connolly thought that her husband had been killed
but then she noticed an almost imperceptible movement and knew that he was still alive she said quote it's all right be still and quote
the governor was lying with his head on his wife's lap when he heard a shot hit the president
at that point both governor and missus connolly observed brain tissue splattered over the interior of the car
according to governor and missus connolly
it was after this shot that kellerman issued his emergency instructions and the car accelerated
reaction by secret service agents
from the left front running board of the president's follow up car
special agent hill was scanning the few people standing on the south side of elm street after the motor kate had turned off houston street
he estimated that the motor cate had slowed down to approximately nine or ten miles per hour
on the turn at the intersection of houston and elm street and then proceeded at ha rate of twelve to fifteen miles per hour
with the follow up car trailing the president's automobile by approximately five feet
hill heard a noise which seemed to be a firecracker coming from his right rear
he immediately looked to his right quote and in so doing my eyes had to cross the presidential limousine
and i saw president kennedy grabbe at himself and lurched forward and to the left and quote
he'll jump from the follow up car and ran to the president's automobile
at about the time he reached the president's automobile
hale heard a second shot proximately five seconds after the first which removed a portion of the president's head
at the instant that hill stepped on to the left rear step of the president's automobile and grasped the handhold
the car lurched forward causing him to lose his footing he ran three or four steps regained his position and mounted the car
between the time he originally seized the handhold and the time he mounted the car
hill recalled
wor missus kennedy had jumped up from the seat and was it appeared to me reaching for something coming off the right rear bumper of the car
the right reared tail when she noticed that i was trying to climb on the car
she turned toward me and i grabbed her and put her back in the back seat crawled up on top of the back seat and lay there
david powers who witnessed the scene from the president's follow up car
stated that missus kennedy would probably have fallen off the rear end of the car and been killed if hall had not pushed her back into the presidential automobile
missus kennedy had no recollection of climbing on to the back of the car
special agent ready on the right front running board of the presidential follow up car
heard noises that sounded like firecrackers and ran toward the president's limousine
but he was immediately called back by special agent emery p roberts in charge of the follow up car
who did not believe that he could reach the president's car at the speed it was then travelling
special agent george w hickey junior in the rear seat of the presidential follow u car
picked up and cocked an automatic rifle as he heard the last shot
at this point the cars were speeding through the under pass and had left the scene of the shooting
but hickey kept the automatic weapon ready as the car raced to the hospital
most of the other secret service agents in the motor cate had drawn their side arms
roberts noticed that the vice president's car was approximately one half block
behind the presidential follow up car at the time of the shooting and signaled for it to move in closer
directing the security detail for the vice president from the right front seat of the vice presidential car special agent young blood recalled
quote
as we were beginning to go down this incline all of a sudden there was an explosive noise
i quickly observed unnatural movement of crowds like ducking or scattering and quick movements in the presidential follow up car
so i turned around and hit the vice president on the shoulder and hollered get down
and then looked round again and saw more of this movement and so i proceeded to go to the back seat and get on top of him
young blood was not positive that he was in the rear seat before the second shot but thought it probable because of president johnson's statement
to that effect immediately after the assassination
president johnson emphasized young blood's instantaneous reaction after the first shot
i was startled by the sharp report or explosion
but i had no time to speculate as to its origin because agent young blood turned in a flash immediately after the first explosion
hitting me on the shoulder and shouted to all of us in the back seat to get down
i was pushed down by agent young blood
almost in the same moment in which he hit or pushed me he vaulted over the back seat and sat on me
i was bent over under the weight of agent young blood's body toward missus johnson and senator yarborough
andqute
cliftin sea carter riding in the vice president's follow up car a short distance behind
reported that young blood was in the rear seat using his body to shield the vice president before the second and third shots were fired
altheir secret service agents assigned to the motor cade remained at their posts during the race to the hospital
none stayed at the scene of the shooting and none entered the texas schoolbook depository building at or immediately after the shooting
secret service procedure requires that each agent stay with the person being protected
and not be diverted unless it is necessary to accomplish the protective assignment
forest thee sorrels special agent in charge of the dalis office
was the first secret service agent to return to the scene of the assassination
approximately twenty or twenty five minutes after the shots were fired

upon arriving at parkland hospital
lawson jumped from the lead car and rushed into the emergency entrance where he was met by hospital staff members wheeling stretchers out to the automobile
special agent hill removed his suit jacket and covered the president's head and upper chest to prevent the taking of photographs
governor connolly who had lost consciousness on the ride to the hospital regained consciousness when the limousine stopped abruptly at the emergency entrance
despite his serious wounds governor connolly tried to get out of the way so that medical help could reach the president
although he was reclining in his wife's arms he lurched forward in an effort to stand upright and get out of the car but he collapsed again
then he experienced his first sensation of pain which became excruciating
the governor was lifted on to a stretcher and taken into trummer room too
for a moment missus kennedy refused to release the president whom she held in her lap
but then kellermen grear and lostson lifted the president on to a stretcher and pushed it into trummer room one
treatment of president kennedy
the first physician to see the president at parkland hospital was doctor charles j carico a resident in general surgery
doctor carriko was in the emergency area examining another patient when he was notified that president kennedy was on route to the hospital
approximately two minutes later doctor carriko saw the president on his back being wheeled into the emergency area
he noted that the president was blue white or ashen in color had slow spasmodic agonal respiration without any coordination
made no voluntary movements had his eyes open with the pupils dilated without any reaction to light
evidenced no palpable pulse and had a few chest sounds which were thought to be heart beats
on the basis of these findings doctor carrico concluded that president kennedy was still alive
doctor carriko noted two wounds a small bullet wound in the front lower neck
and an extensive wound in the president's head where a sizable portion of the skull was missing
he observed shredded brain tissue and quote considerable slow oozing and quote from the latter wound
followed by quote more profuse bleeding and quote after some circulation was established
doctor carriko felt the president's back and determined that there was no large wound there which would be an immediate ret to life
observing the serious problems presented by the head wound and inadequate respiration doctor carrico directed his attention to improving the president's breathing
he noted contusions hematoma to the right of the larynx which was deviated slightly to the left
and also ragged tissue which indicated a trichial injury
doctor carriko inserted a cuffed and outrachial tube past the injury inflated the cough and connected it to a bennet machine to assist in respiration
at that point direction of the president's treatment was undertaken by doctor malcolm o perry who arrived at trammar room one a few moments after the president
doctor perry noted the president's back brace as he felt for a femeral pulse which he did not find
observing that an effective air way had to be established if treatment was to be effective doctor perry performed a tracheotomy which required three to five minutes
while doctor perry was performing the trancheotomy doctorss carrico and ronald jones made cut downs on the president's right leg and left arm respectively
to infuse blood and fluids into the circulatory system
doctor carribo treated the president's known add renal insufficiency by administering hydro courtizone
doctor robert and mc clelland entered at that point and assisted doctor perry with the trackhy otomy
doctor foued ba shure chief of cordeology doctor m t jenkins chief of anesthesiology
and doctor a h g sec junior
then joined in the effort to revive the president
when doctor perry noted free air and blood in the president's chest cavity he asked that chest tubes be inserted to allow for drainage of blood and air
doctors paul c peters
and charles r baxter initiated these procedures
as a result of the infusion of liquids through the cut downs the cardiac massage and the airway
the doctors were able to maintain perifheral circulation as monitored at the neck caroted artery and at the wrist radio pulse
a femeral pulse was also detected in the president's leg
while these medical efforts were in progress
doctor clarke noted some electrical activity on the cartio tecoscope attached to monitor the president's heart responses
doctor clarke who most closely observed a head wound
described a large gaping wound in the right rear part of the head with substantial damage and exposure of brain tissue and a considerable loss of blood
doctor clarke did not see any other hole or wound on the president's head
according to doctor clarke a small bullet hole on the right rear of the president's head discovered during the subsequent autopsy
quote could have easily been hidden in the blood and hair and quote
in the absence of any neurological muscular or heart response the doctors concluded that efforts to revive the president were hopeless
this was verified by admiral berkeley the president's physician who arrived at the hospital after emergency treatment was under way and concluded that quote
my direct services to him at that moment would have interfered with the action of the team which was in progress and quote
at approximately one p m after last rites were administered to the president by father oscar l huber doctor clarke pronounced the president did
he made the official determination because the ultimate cause of death the severe head injury was within his sphere of specialization
the time was fixed at one p m as an approximation since it was impossible to determine the precise moment when life left the president
president kennedy could have survived the neck injury but the head wound was fatal
from a medical viewpoint president kennedy was alive when he arrived at parkland hospital
the doctors observed that he had a heart beat and was making some respiratory efforts
but his condition was hopeless and the extraordinary efforts of the doctors to save him could not help but to have been unavailing
since the dalliss doctors directed all their efforts to controlling the massive bleeding caused by the head wound and to reconstructing an airway to his lungs
the president remained on his back throughout his medical treatment at parkland
when asked why he did not turn the president over doctor carrico testified as follows
this man was in obvious extreme distress and any more thorough inspection would have involved several minutes well several
considerable time which at this juncture was not available
a thorough inspection would have involved a washing and cleansing the back and this is not practical in treating and acutely injured patient
you have to determine which things which are immediately life threatening and cope with them before attempting to evaluate the full extent of the injuries
did you ever have occasion to look at the president's back
answer no sir before well in trying to treat and acutely injured patient you have to establish an air way adequate ventilation
and you have to establish adequate circulation
before this was accomplished the president's cardiac activity had ceased and closed cardiac massage was instituted which made it impossible to inspect his back
question was any effort made to inspect the president's back after he had expired answer no sir
question and why was no effort made at that time to inspect his back answer
i suppose nobody really had the heart to do it
moreover the parkland doctors took no further action after the president had expired because they concluded that it was beyond the scope of their permissible duties
treatment of governor connolly
while one medical team tried to revive president kennedy a second performed a series of operations on the bullet wounds sustained by governor connolly
governor connolly was originally seen by doctor carico and doctor richard delaney
while doctor carriko went on to attend the president doctor delaney stayed with the governor and was soon joined by several other doctors
at approximately twelve forty five p m doctor robert shaw
chief of theoracic surgery arrived at trammer room too to take charge of the care of governor connolly
whose major wound fell within doctor shaw's area of specialization
governor connolly had a large sucking wound in the front of the right chest which caused extreme pain and difficulty in breathing
rubber tubes were inserted between the second and third ribs to re expand the right lung which had collapsed because of the opening in the chest wall
at one thirty five p m after governor connolly had been moved to the operating room doctor shaw started the first operation
by cutting away the edges of the wound on the front of the governor's chest and sucuring the damaged long and lacerated muscles
the elliptical wound in the governor's back located slightly to the left of the governor's right armpit approximately five eighths inch a centimeter and a half
in its greatest diameter was treated by cutting away the damaged skin and suituring the back muscle and skin
this operation was concluded at three twenty p m
two additional operations were performed on governor connolly for wounds which he had not realized he had sustained until he regained consciousness the following day
from approximately four p m to four fifty p m on november twenty two
doctor charles f gregory chief of orthopedic surgery operated on the wounds of governor connolly's right wrist
assisted by doctors william osborne and john parker
the wound on the back of the wrist was left partially open for draining and the wound on the palm side was enlarged cleansed and closed
the fracture was set and a cast was applied with some traction utilized
while the second operation was in progress
doctor george t shyers assisted by doctors robert mc clelland charles baxter and ralph don packman
treated the gunshot wound in the left thigh
this punctuate missal wound about two fifths inch in diameter one sent to meet her and located approximately five inches above the left knee
was cleansed and cloted with suitors but a small metallic fragment remained in the governor's leg
vice president johnson at parkland
as president kennedy and governor connolly were being removed from the limousine on to stretchers
a protective circle of secret service agents surrounded vice president and missus johnson
and escorted them into parkland hospital through the emergency entrance
the agents moved a nurse and patient out of a near by room
lowered the shades and took emergency security measures to protect the vice president
two men from the president's follow up car were detailed to help protect the vice president
an agent was stationed at the entrance to stop anyone who was not a member of the presidential party
u s representatives henry be gonzalez
jack brooks homer thornbury and albert thomas joined clifton sea carter and the group of special agents protecting the vice president
on one occasion missus johnson accompanied by two secret service agents left the room to see missus kennedy and missus connolly
concerned that the vice president might also be a target for assassination prompted the secret service agents to urge him to leave the hospital and return to washington immediately
the vice president decided to wait until he received definitive word of the president's condition
at approximately one twenty p m vice president johnson was notified by o'donnell that president kennedy was sticked
special agent young blood learned from missus johnson a location of her two daughters
and made arrangements through secret service headquarters in washington to provide them with protection immediately
when consulted by the vice president o'donnell advised him to go to the air field immediately and returned to washington
it was decided that the vice president should return on the presidential plane rather than on the vice presidential plane because it had better communication equipment
the vice president conferred with white house assistant press secretary malcolm kildoff
and decided that there would be no release of the news of the president's death until the vice president had left the hospital
when told that missus kennedy refused to lead without the president's body the vice president said that he would not leave dalic without her
on the recommendation of the secret service agents vice president johnson decided to board the presidential aerplane ere force won
and wait for missus kennedy and the president's body
secret service emergency security arrangements
immediately after president kennedy's stretcher was wheeled into trama room one secret service agents took positions at the door of the small emergency room
a nurse was asked to identify hospital personnel and to tell everyone except necessary medical staff members to leave the emergency room
other secret service agents posted themselves in the corridors and other areas near the emergency room
special agent loss an made certain that the dalless police kept the public and press away from the immediate area of the hospital
agents kellermen and hill telephoned the head of the white house detail gerald a ben to advise him of the assassination
htelephone line to washington was kept open throughout the remainder of this stay at the hospital
secret service agents stationed at later stops on the president's itinerary of november twenty two were redeployed
men at the trade mark were driven to parkland hospital in dallis police cars
the secret service group awaiting the president in austin were instructed to return to washington
meanwhile the secret service agents in charge of security at love field started to make arrangements for departure
as soon as one of the agents learned of the shooting he asked the officer in charge of the police detail of the airport
to institute strict security measures for the presidential air craft the airport terminal and the surrounding area
the police were cautioned to prevent picture taking
secret service agents working with police cleared the areas adjacent to the aircraft including warehouses
other terminal buildings and the neighboring parking lots of all people
the agents decided not to shift the presidential air craft to the far side of the airport because the original landing area was secure
and a move would require new measures
when security arrangements at the airport were complete the secret service made the necessary arrangements for the vice president to leave the hospital
unmarked police cars took the vice president and missus johnson from parkland hospital to love field
chief curry drove one automobile occupied by vice president johnson u s representatives thomas and thornbury and special agent young blood
in another car missus johnson was driven to the airport accompanied by secret service agents and representative brooks
motor kate policeman who escorted the automobiles were requested by the vice president and agent young blood not to use sirens
during the drive vice president johnson at young blood's instruction kept below window level
removal of the president's body
while the team of doctors at parkland hospital tried desperately to save the life of president kennedy
missus kennedy alternated between watching them and waiting outside
after the president was pronounced dead
o'donnell tried to persuade missus kennedy to leave the area but she refused
she said that she intended to stay with her husband
a casket was obtained
and the president's body was prepared for removal
before the body could be taken from the hospital
two dablous officials informed members of the president's start that the body could not be removed from the city until an autopsy was performed
despite the protests of these officials the casket was wheeled out of the hospital placed in an ambulance and transported to the airport shortly after two p m
at approximately two fifteen p m the casket was loaded with some difficulty because of the narrow aierplane door
on to the rear of the presidential plane where seats had been removed to make room
concerned that the local officials might try to prevent the plain's departure o'donnell asked let the pilot take off immediately
he was informed that take off would be delayed until vice president johnson was sworn in
swearing in of the new president
from the presidential aeroplane the vice president telephoned attorney general robert f kennedy
who advised that mister johnson take the presidential oath of office before the plain left dalic
federal judge sarah t hughes hastened to the plain to administer the oath
members of the presidential and vice presidential parties filled the central compartment of the plain to witness the swearing in
at two thirty eight p m eastern standard time lindon baines johnson took the oath of office as the thirty sixth president of the united states
missus kennedy and missus johnson stood at the side of the new president as he took the oath of office
nine minutes later the presidential aeroplane departed for washington d c
returned to washington d c
on the return flight missus kennedy sat with david powers kenneth o'donnell and lawrence o'brien
at five fifty eight p m eastern standard time
ere force one landed at andrews theirefore space where president kennedy had begun his last trip only thirty one hours before
detailed security arrangements had been made by radio from the president's plane on the return flight
the public had been excluded from the base and only government officials and the press were permitted near the landing area
upon arrival president johnson made a brief statement over television and radio
president and missus johnson were flown by helicopter to the white house from where missus johnson was driven to her residence under secret service escort
the president then walked to the executive office building where he worked until nine p m
given a choice between the national naval medical centre at the thesda maryland and the armies walter reed hospital
missus kennedy chose the hospital in the festa for the autopsy because the president had served in the navy
missus kennedy and the attorney general
with three secret service agents accompanied president kennedy's body on the forty five minute automobile trip from andrew's air for space to the hospital
on the seventeenth floor of the hospital missus kennedy and the attorney general joined other members of the kennedy family to await the conclusion of the autopsy
missus kennedy was guarded by secret service agents in quarters assigned to her in the naval hospital
the secret service established a communication system with the white house and screened all telephone calls and visitors
the hospital received the president's body for autopsy at approximately seven thirty five p m
x rays and photographs were taken preliminarily and the pathological examination began at about eight p m
the autopsy report noted that president kennedy was forty six years of age seventy two and one half inches tall
weighed one hundred seventy pounds had blue eyes and reddish brown hair
the body was muscular and well developed with no gross skeletol abnormalities except for those caused by the gunshot wounds
under pathological diagnosis the cause of death was set forth as gunshot wound head
the autopsy examination revealed two wounds in the president's head
one wound approximately one fourth of an inch by five eighths of an inch six by fifteen millimeters
was located about an inch two point five centimeters to the right and slightly above the large bony protrusion
external occipital protuberance which juts out at the centr of the lower part of the back of the skull
the second head wound measured approximately five inches thirteen centimeters in its greatest diameter
but was difficult to measure accurately because multiple criss crossed fractures radiated from the large defect
during the autopsy examination federal agents brought the surgeons three pieces of bone recovered from elm street and the presidential automobile
when put together these fragments accounted for approximately three quarters of the missing portion of the skull
the surgeons observed through x ray analysis thirty or forty tiny dustlike fragments of metal
running in a line from the wound in the rear of the president's head toward the front part of the skull
with assizable metal fragment lying just above the right eye
from this head wound two small irregularly shaped fragments of metal were recovered and turned over to the f be i
the autopsy also disclosed a wound near the base of the back of president kennedy's neck slightly to the right of his spine
the doctors traced the course of the bullet through the body and as information was received from parkland hospital
concluded that the bullet had emerged from the front portion of the president's neck that had been cut away by the triccheotomy at parkland
the nature and characteristics of this neck wound are discussed fully in the next chapter
after the autopsy was concluded at approximately eleven p m the president's body was prepared for burial
this was finished at approximately for a m
shortly thereafter the president's wife family and aids left the festan naval hospital
the president's body was taken to the east room of the white house where it was placed under ceremonial military guard

purchase of rifle by oswald
shortly after the manliker carcano rifle was found on the sixth floor of the texas schoolbook depository building
agents of the f be in
learned from retail outlets and dawlis that crescent firearms ink of new york city
was a distributor of surplus italian six point five millimetere military rifles during the evening of november twenty twoth nineteen sixty three
a review of the records of crescent firearms revealed that the firm had shipped an italian carbine serial number c two seven six six
to clines sporting goods company of chicago illinois
after searching their records from ten p m to four a m
the officers of clines discovered that a rifle bearing serial number see two seven six six had been shipped to one a hidel
post office box two nine one five dalas texas on march twentieth nineteen sixty three
according to its microfilm records clints received an order for a rifle on march thirteenth nineteen sixty three
on a cupon clipped from the february nineteen sixty three issue of the american riflemen magazine
the order cupon was signed in hand printing a hadel p o box two nine one five dallast texas
it was sent in an envelope bearing the same name and return address in handwriting
document examiners for the treasury department and be f be i
testified unequivocally
that the bold printing on the face of the mail or a cupon was in the hand printing of lee harvey oswald and that the writing on the envelope was also his
oswald's writing on these and other documents was identified by comparing the writing and printing on the documents in question
withthout appearing on documents known to have been written by oswald such as his letters passport application and indorsements of checks
in addition to the order cupon the envelope contained a u s postal money order for twenty one dollars forty five cents
purchased as number two two zero two one three zero four six two in dowlest texas on march twelfth nineteen sixty three
the cancelled money order was obtained from the post office department
opposite the printed words pay too
were written the words clines sporting goods
and opposite the printed word from
were written the words
a hadel
p o box two nine one five dallost texas
these words were also in the handwriting of lee harvey oswald
from cline's records it was possible to trace the processing of the order after its receipt
a bank deposit made on march thirteenth nineteen sixty three
included an item of twenty one dollars forty five cents

climes shipping order form
shows an imprint made by the cash register which recorded the receipt of twenty one dollars forty five cents on march thirteenth nineteen sixty three
this price included nineteen dollars ninety five cents for the rifle and the scope and one dollar fifty cents for postage and handling
the rifle without the scope cost only twelve dollars seventy eight cents
according to the vice president of clynes william waldman
the scope was mounted on the rifle by a gunsmith employed by climbs and the rifle was shipped fully assembled in accordance with customary company procedures
the specific rifle shipped against the order had been received by climes from crescent on february twenty one nineteen sixty three
it bore the manufacturer serial number c two seven six six
on that date clines placed an internal control number v c eight three six on this rifle
according to cleine's shipping order form one italian carbine six point five ex four ex scope
control number v c eight three six serial number c to seven six six was shipped parcel post too
a hadel p o box two nine one five dalas texas on march twenty nineteen sixty three
information received from the italian armed forces intelligence service has established that this particular rifle was the only rifle of its type
bearing serial number c to seven six six
the post office box to which the rifle was shipped was rented to lee h oswald from october ninth
nineteen sixty two
to may fourteenth nineteen sixty three
experts on handwriting identification from the treasury department and the f be i
testified that the signature and other writing on the application for that box were in the handwriting of lee harvey oswald
as was a change of a dress card dated may twelfth nineteen sixty three
by which oswald requested that mail addressed to that box be forwarded to him in new orleans where he had moved on april twenty fourth
since the rifle was shipped from chicago on march twenty nineteen sixty three it was received in dallas during the period when oswald rented and used the box
it is not known whether the application for post office box two nine one five listed a hiddel as a person entitled to receive mail at this box
in accordance with postal regulations a portion of the application which lists names of persons other than the applicant entitled to receive mail
was thrown away after the box was closed in may nineteen sixty three
postal inspector harry d holmes of the dallast post office testified however that when a package is received for certain box
a notice is placed in that box regardless of whether the name on the package is elisted on the application as a person entitled to receive mail through that box
the person having access to the box then takes the notice to the window and is given the package
ordinarily inspector holmes testified identification is not requested because it is assumed that the person with the notice is entitled to the package
oswald's use of the name hadel to purchase the assassination weapon
was one of several instances in which he used this name as an alias
when arrested on the day of the assassination he had in his possession a smith in wesson thirty eight caliber revolver
purchased by mail ordor cupon from seaport traders ink a mail loader division of george rose and company los angeles
the mail oader cupon listed the purchaser as a j hedel aged twenty eight
with the address of post office box two nine one five in dawlis
handwriting experts from the f b i and the treasury department testified that the writing on the mail order form was that of lee harvey oswald
among other identification cards in oswald's wallet at the time of his arrest were a selective service notice of classification
a selective service registration certificate and a certificate of service in the u s marine corps
all three cards being in his own name
also in his wallet at that time
were a selective service notice of classification and a marine certificate of service in the name of alec james hidel
on the headel's selective service card there appeared a signature alec j hidel
and the photograph of lee harvey oswald
experts on questioned documents from the treasury department and the f be i testified that the hadel cards were counterfeit photographic reproductions
made by photographing the oswald cards retouching the resulting negatives and producing prince from the retouched negatives
he had del signature on the notice of classification was in the handwriting of oswald
in oswald's personal effects found in his room at ten twenty six north beckley avenue in dalis
was a purported international certificate of vaccination signed by doctor a j edel
post office box three zero zero one six new orleans
it certified that lee harvey oswald had been vaccinated for small pox on june eighth nineteen sixty three
this too was a forgery the signature of a j hidil
was in the handwriting of lee harvey oswald
there is no doctor hideal licensed to practice medicine in louisiana
there is no post office box three zero zero once sixh in the new orleans post office
but oswald had rented post office box three ziro zero six one
in new orleans
on june three nineteen sixty three
listing marina oswald and a j hadel
as additional persons entitled to receive mail
in the box
the new orleans postal authorities had not discarded the portion of the application
listing the names of those other than the owner of the box entitled to receive mail through the box
expert testimony
confirmed that the writing on this application
was that of lee harvey oswald
chadel's name on the post office box application
was part of oswald use of a non existent hidel
to serve as president of the so called new orleans chapter of the fair play for cuba committee
marina oswald
testified
that she first learned of oswald's use of the fictitious name haddel
in connection with his pro castro activities in new orleans
according to her testimony
he compelled her to write the name headel on membership cards in the space designated for the signature of the chapter president
the name had del was stamped on some of the chapters printed literature and on the membership application blanks
marina oswald testified
quote i knew there was no such organization
and i know hidel is merely an altered fidel
and i laughed at such foolishness
and quote
hidel was a fictitious president
of an organization of which oswald was the only member
when seeking employment in new orleans
oswald listed a sergeant robert hedel
as a reference on one job application
and george hedel
as a reference on another
both names were found to be fictitious
mer azor
the use of alec as a first name for hidel is a further link to oswald because alec was oswald's nickname in russia
letters received by marina oswald from her husband signed alec
were given to the commission
oswald's palm print on rifle barrel
based on the above evidence the commission concluded that oswald purchased the rifle found on the sixth floor of the depository building
additional evidence of ownership was provided in the form of palm print identification which indicated that oswald had possession of the rifle he had purchased
a few minutes after the rifle was discovered on the sixth floor of the depository building
it was examined by lieutenant j c day of the identification bureau of the dallist plice
he lifted the rifle by the wooden stolk
after his examination convinced him that the wood was too rough to take finger prints
captain j w fritz then ejected a cartridge by operating the bolt
but only after day viewed the knob on the bolt through a magnifying glass and found no prince
dey continued to examine the rifle with a magnifying glass looking for possible fingerprints
he applied finger print powder to the side of the metal housing near the trigger
and noticed traces of two prints
at eleven forty five p m on november twenty two
the rifle was released to the f be i
and forwarded to washington
where it was examined on the morning of november twenty three
by sebastian f latona
supervisor
of the latent fingerprint section of the f f eye's identification division
in his testimony before the commission
latona stated that when he received the rifle the area where prints were visible was protected by selfane
he examined these prints as well as photographs of them which the dabless police had made and concluded that
quote
the formations the rich formations and characteristics
were insufficient for purposes of either affecting identification
or a determination that the print was not identical with the prince of people
accordingly my opinion simply was that the latent prince which were there were of no value
and quote
latona then processed the complete weapon
but develope no identifiable prince
he stated that the poor quality of the wood and the metal
would cause the rifle to absorb moisture from the skin
thereby making a clear print unlikely
on november twenty two however
before surrendering possession of the rifle to the f beid laboratory
lieutenant day of the dallist police department
had lifted a palm print from the under side of the gun barrel
quote
near the firing end of the barrel
about three inches under the wood stalk when i took the wood stock loose and quote
lifting a print
involves the use of adhesive material
to remove the fingerprint powder which adheres to the original print
in this way the powdered impression is actually removed from the object
the lifting had been so complete in this case that there was no trace of the print on the rifle itself
when it was examined by latona
nor was there any indication that the lift had been performed
day on the other hand
believed that sufficient traces of the print had been left on the rifle barrel
because he did not release the lifted print until november twenty sixth
when he received instructions to send everything that we had
to the f beyond
the print arrived in the f biale laboratory in washington on november twenty ninth mounted on a card on which lieutenant day had written the words
quote
off underside gun barrel
near end of grip
see two seven six six and quote
the princes positive identity as having been lifted from the rifle
was confirmed by f beyind laboratory tests which established that the adhesive material bearing the print
also bore impressions of the same irregularities that appeared on the barrel of the rifle
latona testified that this palm print was the right pam print of lee harvey oswald
at the request of the commission arthur mendella
finger print expert with the new york city police department
conducted an independent examination and also determined
that this was the right palm print of oswald
latona's findings were also confirmed by ronald g whitnmess another f bi ie fingerprint expert
in the opinion of these experts it was not possible to estimate the time which elapsed between the placing of the print on the rifle and the date of the lift
experts testifying before the commission agreed that palm prints are as unique as finger prints for purposes of establishing identification
oswald's palm print on the under side of the barrel
demonstrates that he handled the rifle when it was dissembled
a palm print could not be placed on this portion of the rifle when assembled because the wooden for grip covers the barrel at this point
the print is additional proof that the rifle was in oswald's possession
fibres on rifle
in a crevice between the butt plate of the rifle and the wooden stalk
was a tuft of several cotton fibres of dark blue
gray black
and orange yellow shades
on november twenty three nineteen sixty three
these fibres were examined by paul m stamboul
a special agent assigned to the hair and fibre unit of the f biie laboratory
he compared them with the fibres found in the shirt which oswald was wearing when arrested in the texas theatre
this shirt was also composed of dark blue
gray black and orange yellow cotton fibres
stombau testified that the colors shades and twist of the fibres found in the tuft on the rifle
matched those in oswald's shirt
stambo explained in his testimony
that in fibre analysis as distinct from finger print or firearm's identification
it is not possible to state with scientific certainty that a particular small group of fibres come from a certain piece of clothing
to the exclusion of all others because there are not enough microscopic characteristics present in fibres
judgments as to probability will depend on the number and types of matches
he concluded quote
there is no doubt in my mind that these fibres could have come from this shirt
there is no way however to eliminate the possibility of the fibres having come from another identical shirt
and quoth
having considered the probabilities as explained in stomball's testimony
the commission has concluded that the fibres in the tuft on the rifle most probably came from the shirt worn by oswald when he was arrested
and that this was the same shirt which oswald wore on the morning of the assassination
marina oswald testified that she thought her husband wore this shirt to work on that day
the testimony of those who saw him after the assassination
was inconclusive about the color of oswald's shirt
but mary bledso a former landlady of oswald saw him on a bus approximately ten minutes after the assassination
and identified the shirt as being the one worn by oswald primarily because of a distinctive hole in the shirt's right elbow
moreover
the best transfer which he obtained as he left the bus
was still in the pocket when he was arrested
although oswald returned to his rooming house after the assassination
and when questioned by the police claimed to have changed his shirt
the evidence indicates that he continued wearing the same shirt which he was wearing all morning
and which he was still wearing when arrested
in light of these findings the commission evaluated the additional testimony of stamball
that the fibres were caught in the crevice of the rifles butt plate
quote in the recent past and quote
although stombou was unable to estimate the period of time the fibres were on the rifle

he said that the fibres quote
were clean they had good color to them
there was no grease on them and they were not fragmented they looked as if they had just been picked up and quote
the relative freshness of the fibres is strong evidence
that they were caught on the rifle on the morning of the assassination
or during the preceding evening
for ten days prior to the eve of the assassination
oswald had not been present at ruth payne's house in irving texas where the rifle was kept
moreover the commission found no reliable evidence
that oswald used the rifle at any time between september twenty three
when it was transported from new orleans and november twenty two the day of the assassination
the fact that on the morning of the assassination
oswald was wearing the shirt from which these relatively fresh fibres most probably originated
provides some evidence that they were placed on the rifle that day
since there was limited if any opportunity for oswald to handle the weapon during the two months prior to november twenty two
on the other hand stomball pointed out that fibres might retain their freshness if the rifle had been
quothe put aside and quote after catching the fibres
the rifle used in the assassination
probably had been wrapped in a blanket for about eight weeks prior to november twenty two

because the relative freshness of these fibres might be explained by the continuous storage of the rifle in the blanket
the commission was unable to reach any firm conclusion
as to when the fibres were caught in the rifle
the commission was able to conclude however
that the fibres most probably came from oswald's shirt
this adds to the conviction of the commission
that oswald owned and handled the weapon used in the assassination
photograph of oswald with rifle
during the period from march two nineteen sixty three to april twenty fourth nineteen sixty three
the oswalds lived on neelie street in dawlis
in a rented house which had a small back yard
one sunday
while his wife was hanging dipers oswald asked her to take a picture of him holding a rifle a pistol
and issues of two newspapers later identified as the worker and the militant
two pictures were taken
the commission has concluded that the rifle shown in these pictures is the same rifle which was found on the sixth floor of the depository building

i found it to be the same general configuration
all appearances were the same and quote
he found what one notch in the stock at this point that appears very faintly in the photograph and quote
he stated however that while he quote found no differences and quote between the rifles and the two photographs he could not make a quote positive identification
to the exclusion of all other rifles of the same general configuration and a quote
the authenticity of these pictures has been established by expert testimony which links the second picture
commission exhibit number one thirty three b to oswald's imperial reflex camera with which marina oswald testified she took the pictures
the negative of that picture commission exhibit number one thirty three b was found among oswald's possessions
using a recognized technique of determining whether a picture was taken with a particular camera
shany felt compared this negative with a negative which he made by taking a new picture with oswald's camera
he concluded that the negative of exhibit number one thirty three b was exposed in oswald's imperial reflex camera to the exclusion of all other cameras
he could not test exhibit number one thirty three a in the same way because the negative was never recovered
both pictures however have identical backgrounds and lighting and judging from the shadows were taken at the same angle
they are photographs of the same scene
since exhibit number one thirty three b was taken with oswald camera
it is reasonably certain that exhibit number one thirty three a was taken by the same camera at the same time as marina oswald testified
moreover shady felt testified that in his opinion
the photographs were not composites of two different photographs
and that oswald's face had not been superiposed on another body
one of the photographs taken by marina oswald was widely published in newspapers and magazines
and in many instances the details of these pictures differend from the original and even from each other
particularly as to the configuration of the rifle
the commission sought to determine whether these photographs were touched prior to publication
shady felt testified that the published photographs appeared to be based on a copy of the original which the publications had each retouched differently
several of the publications furnished the commission with the prince they had used or described by correspondence the retouching they had done
this information enabled the commission to conclude
that the published pictures were the same as the original except for retouching done by these publications apparently for the purpose of clarifying the lines of the rifle
and other details in the picture
the dates surrounding the taking of this picture and the purchase of the rifle
reinforced the belief that the rifle in the photograph is the rifle which oswald bought from climes
the rifle was shipped from clins in chicago on march twenty nineteen sixty three at a time when the oswald were living on neelie street
from an examination of one of the photographs the commission determined the dates of the issues of the militant and the worker which oswald was holding in his hand
by checking the actual mailing dates of these issues and the time it usually takes to effect delivery to dalis
it was established that the photographs must have been taken some time after march twenty seventh
marina oswald testified that the photographs were taken on a sunday about two weeks before the attempted shooting of major general edwin a walker
on april tenth nineteen sixty three
by sunday march thirty one nineteen sixty three
ten days prior to the walker attempt oswald had undoubtedly received the rifle shipped from chicago on march twenty
the revolver shipped from los angeles on the same date and the two newspapers which he was holding in the picture
rifle among oswald's possessions
marina oswald testified that the rifle found on the sixth floor of the depository building was the quote fateful rifle of leoswald
moreover it was the only rifle owned by her husband following his return from the soviet union in june nineteen sixty two
it had been purchased in march nineteen sixty three and taken to new orleans where marina oswald saw it in their rented apartment
during the summer of nineteen sixty three
it appears from his wife's testimony
that oswald may have sat on the screened in porch at night
practising with the rifle by looking through the telescopic site and operating the bolt
in september nineteen sixty three
oswald loaded their possessions into a station wagon owned by ruth payne who had invited marina oswald and the baby to live at her home in irving texas
marina oswald has stated that the rifle was among these possessions
although ruth payne testified that she was not aware of it
from september twenty fourth nineteen sixty three when marina oswald arrived in irving from new orleans until the morning of the assassination
the rifle was according to the evidence stored in a green and brown blanket in the pain's garage among the oswald other possessions
about one week after the return from new orleans
marina oswald was looking in the garage for parts to the baby's crib and thought that the parts might be in the blanket
when she started to open the blanket she saw the stock of the rifle
ruth and michael payne both noticed the rolled up blanket in the garage during the time that marina oswald was living in their home
on several occasions michael payne moved the blanket in the garage
he thought it contained tent poles or possibly other camping equipment such as a folding shovel
when he appeared before the commission michael pane lifted the blanket
with the rifle wrapped inside and testified that it appeared to be the same approximate weight and shape as the package in his garage
about three hours after the assassination a detective and deputy sheriff saw the blanket roll
tied with a string lying on the floor of the paines garage
each man testified that he thought he could detect the outline of a rifle in the blanket even though the blanket was empty
paul m stumbo of the f iane laboratory
examined the blanket and discovered a bulge approximately ten inches long midway in the blanket
this bolt was apparently caused by a hard protruding object which had stretched the blankets fibres
it could have been caused by the telescopic sight of the rifle which was approximately eleven inches long
having reviewed the evidence that one lee harvey oswald purchased the rifle used in the assassination
two oswald's palm print was on the rifle in a position which shows that he had handled it while it was disssembled
three
fibres found on the rifle most probably came from the shirt oswald was wearing on the day of the assassination
four a photograph taken in the yard of oswald's apartment showed him holding this rifle and five
the rifle was kept among oswald's possessions from the time of its purchase until the day of the assassination
the commission concluded that the rifle used to assassinate president kennedy and wound governor connolly was owned and possessed by lee harvey oswald

chapter four the assassin part two
the rifle in the building
the commission has valuated the evidence tending to show how lee harvey oswald's manliquer carcano rifle serial number c to seven six six
was brought into the depository building where it was found on the sixth floor shortly after the assassination
in this connection the commission considered one
the circumstances surrounding oswald's return to irving texas on thursday november twenty onth nineteen sixty three
two the disappearance of the rifle from its normal place of storage three
oswald's arrival at the depository building on november twenty two carrying a long and bulky brown paper package
the presence of a long hand made brown paper bag near the point from which the shots were fired and five the palm print
fibre and paper analyses linking oswald and the assassination weapon to this bag
the curtainrod's story
during october and november of nineteen sixty three
lee harvey oswald lived in a rooming house in dallis while his wife and children lived in irving at the home of ruth payne
approximately fifteen miles from oswald's place of work at the texas schoolbook depository
oswald travelled between dalice and irving on week ends in a car driven by a neighbor of the panes buell wesley fraser
who also worked at the depository
oswald generally would go to irving on friday afternoon and returned to dalla's monday morning
according to the testimony of fraser marina oswald and ruth payne it appears that oswald never returned to irving in midweek
prior to november twenty one nineteen sixty three except on monday october twenty one when he visited his wife in the hospital
after the birth of their second child
during the morning of november twenty one oswald asked fraser whether he could ride home with him that afternoon
fraser surprised asked him why he was going to irving on thursday night rather than friday
oswald replied quote i'm going home to get some curtain rods to put in an apartment and quote
the two men left work at four forty p m and drove to irving
there was little conversation between them on the way home
missus linnie may randall fraser sister commented to her brother about oswald's unusual midweak return to irving
fraser told her that oswald had come home to get curtain rods
it would appear however that obtaining curtain rods was not the purpose of oswald's trip to irving on november twenty one
missus a c johnson his landlady testified that oswald's room at ten twenty six north beckley avenue
had curtains and curtain rods and that oswald had never discussed the subject with her
in the pain's garage along with many other objects of a household character
there were two flat light weight curtain rods belonging to ruth pain but they were still there on friday afternoon after oswald's arrest
oswald never asked missus payne about the use of curtain rods
and marina oswald testified that oswald did not say anything about curtain rods on the day before the assassination
no curtain rods were known to have been discovered in the depository building after the assassination
in deciding whether oswald carried a rifle to work in a long paper bag on november twenty two
the commission gave weight to the fact that oswald gave a false reason for returning home on november twenty one
and one which provided an excuse for the carrying of a bulky packish the following morning
before dinner on november twenty one oswald played on the lawn of the painsas home with his daughter june
after dinner ruth payne and marina oswald were busy cleaning house and preparing their children for bed
between the hours of eight and nine p m they were occupied with the children in the bedrooms located at the extreme east end of the house
on the west end of the house is the attached garage which can be reached from the kitchen or from the outside
in the garage were the personal belongings of the oswald family including as the evidence has shown the rifle wrapped in the old brown and green blanket
at approximately nine p m after the children had been put to bed missus payne according to her testimony before the commission quote
went out to the garage to paint some children's blocks and worked in the garage for half an hour or so
i noticed when i went out that the light was on and quote
missus payne was certain that she had not left the light on in the garage after dinner
according to missus payne oswald had gone to bed by nine p m
marina oswald testified that it was between nine and ten p m
neither marina oswald nor ruth payin saw oswald in the garage
the period between eight and nine p m however provided ample opportunity for oswald to prepare the rifle for his departure the next morning
only if dissembled could the rifle fit into the paper bag found near the window from which the shots were fired
a firearms expert with the f be i assembled the rifle in six minutes using a ten cent coin as a tool
and he could dissemble it more rapidly
while the rifle may have already been dissembled when oswald arrived home on thursday he had ample time that evening to dissemble a rifle
and insert ed into the paper bag
on the day of the assassination marina oswald was watching television when she learned of the shooting
a short time later missus payne told her that someone had shot the president quote from the building in which lee is working and quote
marina oswald testified that at the time quote my heart dropped
i then went to the garage to see whether the rifle was there
and i saw that the blanket was still there
and i said
thank god
and quote
she did not unroll the blanket she saw that it was in its usual position and it appeared to her to have something inside
soon afterward at about three p m police officers arrived and searched the house
missus payne pointed out that most of the oswald's possessions were in the garage
with ruth payine acting as an interpreter detective rose asked marina whether her husband had a rifle
missus payne who had no knowledge of the rifle first said no but when the question was translated marina oswald replied yes
she pointed to the blanket which was on the floor very close to where ruth payne was standing
missus payne testify quote
as she marina told me about it i stepped on to the blanket roll
and she indicated to me that she had peered into this roll and saw a portion of what she took to be a gun she knew her husband to have a rifle
and i then translated this to the officers that she knew that her husband had a gun that he had stored in here
i then stepped off of it and the officer picked it up in the middle and it bent so
missus payne had the actual blanket before her as she testified and she indicated that the blanket hung limp in the officer's hand
marina oswald testified that this was her first knowledge that the rifle was not in its accustomed place
the long and bulky package
on the morning of november twenty two nineteen sixty three
lee harvey oswald left the pain house in irving at approximately seven fifteen a m while marina oswald was still in bed
neither she nor missus payne saw him leave the house about half a block away from the pain house was the residence of missus linniy may randall
sister of the man with whom oswald drove to work buell wesley fraser
missus randal stated that on the morning of november twenty two while her brother was eating breakfast
she looked out the breakfast room window and saw oswald cross the street and walked toward the driveway where her brother parked his car near the carport
he carried a quot heavy brown bag and quot
oswald gripped the bag in his right hand near the top quote it tapered like this as he hugged it in his hand
it was more bulky toward the bottom and quote then toward the top
she then opened the kitchen door and saw oswald open the right rear door of her brother's car and placed the package in the back of the car
missus randal estimated that the package was approximately twenty eight inches long and about eight inches wide
she thought that its color was similar to that of the bag found on the sixth floor of the school book depository after the assassination
fraser met oswald at the kitchen door and together they walked to the car
after entering the car fraser glanced over his shoulder and noticed a brown paper package on the back seat
he asked quote what's the package lee and quote oswald replied quote curtain rods and quote
fraser told the commission quote
the main reason he was going over there that thursday afternoon when he was to bring back some curtain rods so i didn't think any more about it when he told me that and quote
fraser estimated that the bag was two feet long quote give a take a few inches andqut and about five or six inches wide
as they sat in the car fraser asked oswald where his lunch was and oswald replied that he was going to buy his lunch that day
frazer testified that oswald carried no lunch bag that day
quote when he rode with me i say he always brought lunch except that one day on november twenty two he didn't bring his lunch that day and quote
fraser part the car in the company parking lot about two blocks north of the depository building
oswald left the car first picked up the brown paper bag and proceeded toward the building ahead o fraser
fraser walked behind and as they crossed the railroad tracks he watched the switching of the cars
fraser recalled that one end of the package was under oswald's armpit and the lower part was held with his right hand
so that it was carried straight and parallel to his body
when oswald entered the rear door of the depository building he was about fifty feet ahead of fraser
it was the first time that oswald had not walked with fraser from the parking lot to the building entrance
when fraser entered the building he did not see oswald
one employee jack dardy
believed that he saw oswald coming to work but he does not remember that oswald had anything in his hands as he entered the door
no other employee has been found who saw oswald enter that morning
in deciding whether oswald carried the assassination weapon in the bag which fraser and missus randall saw
the commission has carefully considered the testimony of these two witnesses with regard to the length of the bag
fraser and missus randal testified
that the bag which oswald was carrying was approximately twenty seven or twenty eight inches long whereas the wooden stock of the rifle which is its largest component
measured thirty four point eight inches
the bag found on the sixth floor was eighty eight inches long
when fraser appeared before the commission and was asked to demonstrate how oswald carried the package he said quote like i said
i remember that i didn't look at the package very much but when i did look at it he did have his hands on the package like that and quote and at this point
fraser placed the upper part of the package under his armpit and attempted to cup his right hand beneath the bottom of the bag
the dissembled rifle was too long to be carried in this manner
similarly when the butt of the rifle was placed in fraser's hand it extended above his shoulder to ear level
moreover in an interview on december onth nineteen sixty three withhe agents of the f be i fraser had marked the point on the back seat of his car
which he believed was where the bag reached when it was laid on the seat with one edge against the door
the distance between the point on the seat and the door was twenty seven inches
missus randal said when shown the paper bag
that the bag she saw oswald carrying quote wasn't that long i mean it was folded down at the top as i told you it definitely wasn't that long and quote
and she folded the bag to length of about twenty eight and a half inches
fraser doubted whether the bag that oswald carried was as wide as the bag found on the sixth floor although missus randal testified
that the width was approximately the same
the commission has weighed the visual recollection of fraser and missus randal against the evidence here presented
that the bag oswald carried contained the assassination weapon and has concluded that fraser and randal are mistaken as to the length of the bag
missus randal saw the bag fleetingly
and her first remembrance is that it was held in oswald's right hand quote and it almost touched the ground as he carried it and quote
fraser's view of the bag was from the rear he continually advised that he was not paying close attention for example he said quote
i didn't pay too much attention the way he was walking because i was walking along there looking at the railroad cars and watching the men on the deasel switched them cars
and i didn't pay too much attention on how we carried the package at all and quote
fraser could easily have been mistaken when he stated that oswald held the bottom of the bag cupped in his hand with the upper end tucked into his armpit
location of bag
a hand made bag of wrapping paper and tape was found in the southeast corner of the sixth floor alongside the window from which the shots were fired
it was not a standard type bag which could be obtained in a store and it was presumably made for a particular purpose
it was the appropriate size to contain in dissembled form
oswald's manliker carcano rifle serial number c two seven six six which was also found on the sixth floor
three cartains had been placed at the window apparently to act as a gunrest and a fourth cartaon was placed behind those at the window
a person seated on the fourth cartain could assemble a rifle without being seen from the rest of the sixth floor
because the cartains stacked around the southeast corner which shield him
the presence of the bag in this corner is cogent evidence that it was used as the container for the rifle
at the time the bag was found lieutenant day of the dallist police wrote on it quote found next to the sixth floor window gun fired from
may have been used to carry gun lieutenant j c day and quot
scientific evidence linking rifle and oswald to paper bag
oswald's finger print and palm print found on beck
using a standard chemical method involving silver nitratpes
the f biine laboratory developed a latent palm print and latent finger print on the back
sebastianef latona supervisor of the f b ie's latent fingerprint section
identified these prints as the left index fingerprint and right palm print of lee harvey oswald
the portion of the palm which was identified was the heel of the right palm i e the area near the wrist on the little finger side
these prints were examined independently by ronald g witness of the f b i
and by arthur mendella a fingerprint expert with the new york city police department
both concluded that the prince wore the right palm and left index finger of le oswald no other identifiable prince were found on the back
oswald's calm print on the bottom of the paper bag indicated of course that he had handled the back
furthermore it was consistent with the bag having contained a heavy or bulky object when he handled it since a light object is usually held by the fingers
the palm print was found on the closed end of the bag
it was from oswald's right hand in which he carried the long package as he walked from fraser's car to the building
materials used to make back
on the day of the assassination the dablest police obtained a sample of wrapping paper and tape
from the shipping room of the depository and forwarded it to the f behind laboratory in washington
james c cadogan a questioned documents expert with the bureau compared the samples with the paper and cape in the actual bag
he testified quote
in all the observations and physical tests that i made i found the bag and the paper sample were the same and quote
among other tests the paper and cape were submitted to fibre analysis
and spectrographic examination
in addition the tape was compared to determine whether the sample tape and the tape on the back had been taken from the tape dispensing machine at the depository
when asked to explain the similarity of characteristics
cadagan stated quote well briefly
it would be the thickness of both the paper and the tape the color under various lighting conditions of both the paper and the tape
the width of the tape the gnurled markings on the surface of the fibre the texture of the fibre the letting pattern
i found that the paper sack found on the sixth floor and the sample
had the same observable characteristics both under the microscope and all the visual tests that i could conduct
the papers i also found were similar and fibre composition therefore in addition to the visual characteristics
microscopic and u vi ultra violet characteristics and quote
mister cad again concluded that the paper and tape from the bag were identical in all respects to the sample paper and tape
taken from the texas schoolbook depository shipping room on november twenty twonth nineteen sixty three
on december one nineteen sixty three a replic a bag was made from materials found on that date in the shipping room
this was done as an investigatory aid
since the original bag had been discolored during various laboratory examinations
and could not be used for valid identification by witnesses
cad again found that the paper used to make this replica sack had different characteristics from the paper in the original bag
the science of paper analysis enabled him to distinguish between different rolls of paper even though they were produced by the same manufacturer
since the depository normally used approximately one roll of paper every three working days
it was not surprising that the replic a sack made on december one nineteen sixty three
had different characteristics from both the actual bag and the sample taken on november twenty two
on the other hand since two rolls could be made from the same batch of paper
one cannot estimate when prior to november twenty two oswald made the paper bag
however the complete identity of characteristics between the paper and tape in the bag found on the sixth floor
and the paper and take found in the shipping room of the depository on november twenty two
enabled the commission to conclude that the bag was made from these materials
the depository shipping department was on the first floor to which oswald had access in the normal performance of his duties filling orders
fibres in paper bag matched fibres in blanket
when paul m stomboul of the f biine laboratory examined the paper bag
he found on the inside a single brown de lustered viscost fibre and several light green cotton fibres
the blanket in which the rifle was stored was composed of brown and green cotton biscoast and woollen fibres
the single brown viscos fibre found in the bag matched some of the brown viscos fibres from the blanket in all observable characteristics
the green cotton fibres found in the paper bag matched some of the green cotton fibres in the blanket
quote in all observable microscopic characteristics and quote
despite these matches however stomball was unable to render an opinion that the fibres which he found in the bag had probably come from the blanket
because other types of fibres present in the blanket were not found in the bag
he concluded quote
all i would say here
is that it is possible that these fibres could have come from this blanket
because this blanket is composed of brown and green woollen fibres brown and green delustered viscos fibres and brown and green cotton fibres
we found no brown cotton fibres no green viscoast fibres and no woollen fibres
so if i found all of these than i would have been able to say these fibres probably had come from this blanket but since i found so few
then i would say that possibility exists these fibres could have come from this blanket andqu
stombou confirmed that the rifle could have picked up fibres from the blanket and transferred them to the paper bag
in light of the other evidence linkingly harvey oswald the blanket and the rifle to the paper bag found on the sixth floor
the commission considered stombo's testimony of probitive value in deciding whether oswald carried the rifle into the building in the paper bag
the preponderance of the evidence supports the conclusion that lee harvey osbald won
told the curtain rod story to fraser to explain both the return to irving on a thursday
and the obvious bulk of the package which he intended to bring to work the next day
two took paper and tape from the wrapping bench of the depository and fashioned bag large enough to carry the dissembled rifle
three removed the rifle from the blanket in the paine's garage on thursday evening
for carried the rifle into the depository building concealed in the bag

oswall that window
lee harvey oswald was hired on october fifteenth nineteen sixty three
by the texas school book depository as an order filler
he worked principally on the first and sixth floors of the building gathering books listed on orders and delivering them to the shipping room on the first floor
he had ready access to the sixth floor from the southeast corner window of which the shots were fired
the commission evaluated the physical evidence found near the window after the assassination and the testimony of eyewitnesses
in deciding whetherly harvey oswald was present at this window at the time of the assassination
palm printe and fingerprints on cartains and paper bag
below the southeast corner window on the sixth floor was a large curtain of books
measuring approximately eighteen by twelve by fourteen inches which had been moved from a stack along the south wall
a top this curtain was a small cartan marked rolling readers measuring approximately thirteen by nine by eight inches
in front of this small cartain and resting partially on the window sill was another small rolling reader's cartin
these two small curtains had been moved from a stack about three iles away
the boxes in the window appeared to have been arranged as a convenient gunrest
behind these boxes was another cartain placed on the floor on which a man sitting
could look southwesterly down elm street over the top of the rolling readers cartons
next to these gcarteins was a hand made paper bag previously discussed
on which appeared the print of the left index finger and rite palm of lee harvey oswald
the cartains were forwarded to the f b e of washington
sebastian efflatona supervisor of the latent fingerprint section
testified that twenty identifiable finger prints and eight palm prints were developed on these cartoins
the cartain on the window sill and the large cartain below the window contained no prince which could be identified as being those of lee harvey oswald
the other rolling readers carton however contained a palm print and a finger print which were identified by latona
as being the left palm print and right index fingerprint of lee harvey oswald
the commission has considered the possibility that the cartans might have been moved in connection with the work that was being performed on the sixth floor on november twenty two
depository employees were laying a new floor at the west end and transferring books from the west to the east end of the building
the rolling readers cartons however had not been moved by the floor layers and had apparently been taken to the window from their regular position for some particular purpose
the rolling readers boxes contained instead of books like blocks used as reading aids
they could be easily adjusted and were still solid enough to serve as a gun rest
the box on the floor behind the three near the window
had been one of these moved by the floor layers from the west wall to near the east side of the building in preparation for the laying of the floor
during the afternoon of november twenty two
lieutenant day of the dallis police dusted this carton with powder and developed a palm print on the top edge of the cartain on the side nearest the window
the position of this palm print on the cartain was parallel with the long axis of the box and at right angles with the short axis
the bottom of the palm rested on the box
some one sitting on the box facing the window would have his palm in this position if he placed his hand alongside his right hip
this print which had been cut out of the box was also forwarded to the f bei and latona identified it as oswald's right palm print
in latona's opinion quote
not too long and quote a time had elapsed between the time that the print was placed on the cartain and the time that it had been developed by the daolist police
although bureau experiments had shown that twenty four hours was a likely maximum time latona stated
that he could only testify with certainty that the print was less than three days old
the print therefore could have been placed on the cartan at any time within this period
the freshness of this print could be estimated only because the dalless police developed it through the use of powder
since carton's absorb perspiration
powder can successfully develop a print on such material only within a limited time
when the f b i in washington received the cartans the remaining prince including oswalds on the rolling reader's carton
were developed by chemical processes
the freshness of prints developed in this manner cannot be estimated
so no conclusions can be drawn as to whether these remaining prince preceded or followed the print developed in dalis by powder
most of the prince were found to have been placed on the cartans by an fhbyeye clerk
and a daoliss police officer after the cartons had been processed with powder by the dalolis police
in his independent investigation arthur mendella of the new york city police department
reached the same conclusion as latona that the prince found on the cartains were those of lea harvey oswald
in addition mandella was of the opinion that the print taken from the cartain on the floor
was probably made within a day or a day and a half of the examination on november twenty two
another expert with the f be i ronald g witness conducted a separate examination and also agreed with latona that the prince were oswald's
in evaluating the significance of these finger print and palm print identifications
the commission considered the possibility that oswald handled these cartains as part of his normal duties
since other identifiable prince were developed on the cartains the commission requested that they be compared with the prince of the twelve warehouse employs
who like oswald might have handled the cartons they were also compared with the prince of those low enforcement officials who might have handled the cartons
the results of this investigation are fully discussed in chapter six page two forty nine
although a person could handle a carton
and not leave identifiable prince
none of these employees except oswald left identifiable prince on the cartons
this binding in addition to the freshness of one of the prints and the presence of osmald's prints on two of the four cartons and the paper bag
led the commission to attach some probative value to the finger print and palm print identifications in reaching the conclusion
that oswald was at the window from which the shots were fired although the prince do not establish the exact time he was there
oswald's presence on sixth floor approximately thirty five minutes before the assassination
additional testimony linking oswald with the point from which the shots were fired
was provided by the testimony of charles gibbons who was the last known employee to see oswald inside the building prior to the assassination
during the morning of november twenty two gibbons was working with the floor laying crew in the southwest section of the sixth floor
at about eleven forty five a m the floor laying crew used both elevators to come down from the sixth floor
the employees raced the elevators to the first floor
gibbons saw oswald standing at the gate on the fifth floor as the elevator went by
gibbons testified that after reaching the first floor quote
i discovered i left my cigarettes in my jacket pocket upstairs and i took the elevator back upstairs to get my jacket with my cigarettes in it and quote
he saw oswald a clipboard in hand walking from the southeast corner of the sixth floor toward the elevator
gibbons said to oswald quot boy are you going downstairs it's near lunch time and quote
oswald said quote no sir when you get downstairs close the gate to the elevator and quote
oswald was referring to the west elevator which operates by pushbutton and only with the gate closed gibbons said o k
and rode down in the east elevator
when he reached the first floor the west elevator the one with the gate was not there
gibbons thought this was about eleven fifty five a m
none of the depository employees is known to have seen oswald again until after the shooting
the significance of givens observation that oswald was carrying his clipboard
became apparent on december two nineteen sixty three when an employe franky kaiser
found a clipboard hidden by book cartins in the north west corner of the sixth floor at the west wall a few feet from where the rifle had been found
this clipboard had been made by kaiser and had his name on it
kaiser identified it as the clipboard which oswald had appropriated from him when oswald came to work at the depository
three invoices on this clipboard each dated november twenty two were for scott foresmen books located on the first and sixth floors
oswald had not filled any of the three orders
eye witness identification of assassin
howard el brendan was an eye witness to the shooting as indicated previously the commission considered his testimonyaus probative
in reaching the conclusion that the shots came from the sixth floor southeast corner window of the depository building
bredon also testified that lee harvey oswald
whom he viewed in a police line up on the night of the assassination was the man he saw fire the shots from the sixth floor window of the depository building
when the shots were fired brendan was in an excellent position to observe anyone in the window he was sitting on a concrete wall
on the southwest corner of elm and houston streets looking north at the depository building which was directly in front of him
the window was approximately one hundred twenty feet away
in the six to eight minute period before the motor cade arrived brendan saw a man leave and return to the window quote a couple of times and quote
after hearing the first shot which he thought was a motorcycle backfire brendan glanced up at the window he testified that quote
this man i saw previously was aiming for his last shot as it appeared to me he was standing up and resting against the left window sill and quote
brandan saw the man fire the last shot and disappear from the window
within minutes of the assassination bred and described the man to the police
this description most probably led to the radio alert sent to police cars hat approximately twelve forty five p m which described the suspect as white
slender weighing about one sixty five pounds about five foot ten inches tall and in his early thirties
in his sworn statement to the police later that day
brannan described the men in similar terms except that he gave the weight as between one hundred sixty five and one hundred seventy five pounds and the height was omitted
in his testimony before the commission brendan described the person he saw as quote
a man in his early thirties fair complexion slender but neat meat slender
possible five foot ten
one sixty to one seventy pounds
oswald was five foot nine inches slender and twenty four years old
when arrested he gave his weight as one hundred forty pounds on other occasions he gave weights of both one hundred forty and one hundred fifty pounds
the new orleans police records of his arrest in august of nineteen sixty three show a weight of one hundred thirty six pounds
the autopsy report indicated an estimated weight of one hundred fifty pounds
brennan's description should also be compared with the eye witnessed description broadcast over the dalless police radio at one twenty two p m
of the man who shot pertrome and j d tippet
the suspect was described as quote a white mail about thirty five foot eight black hair slender and quote
at one twenty nine p m the police radio reported
that the description of the suspect in the tippet shooting was similar to the description which had been given by brennan in connection with the assassination
approximately seven or eight minutes later
the police radio reported that quote and eyeball witness and quote described the suspect in the tippet shooting as quote a white mail
twenty seven five foot eleven one hundred sixty five pounds black wavy hair and quote
as will be discussed fully below
the commission has concluded that this suspect was lee harvey oswald
although brendan testified that the man in the window was standing when he fired the shots
most probably he was either sitting or kneeling
the half open window the arrangement of the boxes and the angle of the shots virtually preclude a standing position
it is understandable however for brendan to have believed that the man with the rifle was standing a photograph of the building taken seconds after the assassination
shows three employees looking out of the fifth floor window directly below the window from which the shots were fired
brendan testified that they were standing
which is their apparent position in the photograph
but the testimony of these employees together with photographs subsequently taken of them at the scene of the assassination
establishes that they were either squatting or kneeling
since the window ledges in the depository building are lower than in most buildings
a person squatting or kneeling exposes more of his body than would normally be the case
from the street this creates the impression that the person is standing
brandan could have seen enough of the body of a kneeling or squatting person to estimate his height
shortly after the assassination brendan noticed
two of these employees leaving the building and immediately identified them as having been in the fifth floor windows
when the three employees appeared before the commission brandan identified the two whom he saw leave the building
the two men harold norman and james jarmon junior each confirmed that when they came out of the building
they saw and heard brandon describing what he had seen norman stated quote
jarman heard brandon quote talking to this officer about that he had heard these shots and he had seen the barrel of the gun sticking out the window
and he said that the shots came from inside the building and quote
during the evening of november twenty two brandon identified oswald as the person in the lin up who bore the closest resemblance to the man in the window
but he said he was unable to make a positive identification
prior to the line up
bredon had seen oswald's picture on television and he told the commission that whether this affected his identification quote is something i do not know
in an interview with f b a agents on december seventeenth nineteen sixty three
brandan stated that he was sure that the person firing the rifle was oswald
in another interview with f  a agents on january seventh nineteen sixty four
brendan appeared to revert to his earlier inability to make a positive identification
but in his testimony before the commission brendan stated that his remarks of january seventh were intended by him merely as an accurate report
of what he said on november twenty two
brendan told the commission that he could have made a positive identification in the line up on november twenty two
but did not do so because he felt that the assassination was quote a communist activity
and i felt like there hadn't been more than one eye witness and if it got to be a known fact that i was an eye witness my family or i either one might not be safe
when specifically asked before the commission
whether or not he could positively identify the man he saw in the sixth floor window as the same man he saw in the police station
brennand stated quote i could at that time i could with all sincerity identify him as being the same man and quote
although the record indicates that brandon was an accurate observer he declined to make a positive identification of oswald when he first saw him in the police liner
the commission therefore does not base its conclusion concerning the identity of the assassin
on brandan's subsequent certain identification of le harvey oswald as the man he saw fire the rifle
immediately after the assassination however
brendnan described to the police the man he saw in the window and then identified oswald as the person who most nearly resembled the man he saw
the commission is satisfied that at the least
brandan saw a man in the window who closely resembled lee harvey oswald and that brendon believes the man he saw was in fact
lee harvey oswald
two other witnesses were able to offer partial descriptions of a man they saw in the southeast corner window
of the sixth floor approximately one minute before the assassination although neither witness saw the shots being fired
ronald fisher and robert edwards were standing on the curb at the southwest corner of elmand houston streets
the same corner where brendon was sitting on a concrete wall
fisher testified that about ten or fifteen seconds before the motor cade turned on to houston street from main street
edwards said quote look at that guy there in that window
and quote
fisher looked up and watched the man in the window for ten or fifteen seconds and then started watching the motor cade which came into view on houston street
he said that the man held his attention until the motor cade came because the man quote
appeared uncomfortable for one and secondly he wasn't watching he didn't look like he was watching for the parade
he looked like he was looking down toward the trinity river and the triple underpat down at the end toward the end of elm street and
all the time i watched him he never moved his head he never he never moved anything just was there transfixed
fisher placed the man in the easternmost window on the south side of the depository building on either the fifth or the sixth floor
he said that he could see the man from the middle of his chest to the top of his head and that as he was facing the window the man was in the lower right hand portion of the window
antcote seemed to be sitting a little forward and quote
the man was dressed in a light colored open necked shirt
which could have been either a sport shirt or a tea shirt
and he had brown hair a slender face and neck with light complexion and looked to be twenty two or twenty four years old
the person in the window was a white man and quote looked to me like he was looking straight at the triple underpass and quote down elm street
boxes and cases were stacked behind him
approximately one week after the assassination according to fisher policeman showed him a picture of oswald
in his testimony he said quote
i told them that that could have been the man
that that could have been the man that i saw in the window in the schoolbook depository building
but that i was not sure and quote
fisher described the man's hair as some shade of brown quote it wasn't dark and it wasn't light and quote
on november twenty two fisher had apparently described the man as quote light headed
and quot
fisher explained that he did not mean by the earlier statement that the man was blond but rather that his hair was not black
robert edwards said that while looking at the south side of the depository building shortly before the motor cade
he saw nothing of importance quote except maybe one individual who wis up there in the corner room of the sixth floor which was crowded in among boxes and quote
he said that this was a white man about averagen size quote possibly thin and quot and that he thought the man had light brown hair
fisher and edwards did not see the man clearly enough or long enough to identify him
their testimony is of probitive value however because their limited description is consistent with that of the man who has been found by the commission
based on other evidence to have fired the shots from the window
another person who saw the assassin as the shots were fired was amos l uings aged fifteen
who was one of the first witnesses to alert the police to the depository as the source of the shots as has been discussed in chapter three
ewins who was on the southwest corner of elm and houston streets testified that he could not describe the man he saw in the window
according to ewins however as the man lowered his head in order to aim the rifle down elm street he appeared to have a white bald spot on his head
shortly after the assassination you wins signed in affidavit describing the man as white
but a radio reporter testified that yewans described the man to him as quote colored
and cote
in his commission testimony
youins stated that he could not ascertain the man's race and that the statement in the affidavit was intended to refer only to the white spot on the man's head
and not to his race
a secret service agent who spoke to yew ins approximately twenty to thirty minutes after the assassination
confirmed that yewans could neither describe the man in the window nor indicate his race
accordingly ewins's testimony is considered probitive as to the source of the shots but is inconclusive as to the identity of the man in the window
in evaluating the evidence that oswald was at the southeast corner window of the sixth floor at the time of the shooting
the commission has considered the allegation that oswald was photographed standing in front of the building when the shots were fired
the picture which gave rise to these allegations was taken by associated press photographer james w altons
who was standing on the south side of elm street between the triple underpass and the depository building
as the motor cage started its descent down elm street alchins snapped a picture of the presidential limousine with the entrance to the depository building in the background
just before snapping the picture alchans heard a noise which sounded like the popping of a firecracker
investigation has established that allchenze picture was taken approximately two seconds after the firing of the shot
which entered the back of the president's neck
in the background of this picture were several employees watching the parade from the steps of the depository building
one of these employees was alleged to resemble lee harvey oswald
the commission has determined that the employ was in fact billy love lady who identified himself in the picture
standing alongside him were buell wesley fraser and william shelley who also identified love lady

chapter four the assassin
part four
oswald's actions in building after assassination
in considering whether oswald was at the southeast corner window at the time the shots were fired
the commission has reviewed the testimony of witnesses who saw oswald in the building within minutes after the assassination
the commission has found that oswald's movements as described by these witnesses
are consistent
with his having been at the window
at twelve thirty p m
the encounter in the lunch room
the first person to see oswald after the assassination was patrolmen m l baker of the dallist police department
baker was riding a two wheeled motorcycle behind the last press car of the motor cade
as he turned the corner from maine on to houston at a speed of about five to ten miles per hour
a strong wind blowing from the north almost unseated him
at about this time he heard the first shot
having recently heard the sounds of rifles while on a hunting trip
baker recognized the shots is that of a high powered rifle
quit
it sounded high and i immediately kind have looked up
and i had a feeling that it came from the building
either right in front of me the depository building or of the one across to the right of it
and quote
he saw pigeons flutter upward
he was not certain quote but i am pretty sure they came from the building right on the northwest corner and quote
he heard two more shots spaced quote pretty well even to me
and quote
after the third shot he quote raved that motorcyclelope
and quoth
drove to the northwest corner of elment houston and part approximately ten feet from the traffic signal
as he was parking he noted that people were quote falling and they were rolling round down there grabbing their children and quote and rushing about
a woman screamed quote
oh they have shot that man they have shot that man
and quote
baker quote had it in mind
that the shots came from the top of this building here and quote so he ran straight to the entrance of the depository building
baker testified that he entered the lobby of the building and quote spoke out and asked where the stairs or elevator was
and this man mister truly spoke up and says it seems to me like he says
i am a building manager follow me officer and i will show you
and quote
baker and building superintendent roy truly
went through a second set of doors and stopped at a swinging door
where a baker bumped into truly's back
they went through the swinging door and continued at quote a good trot and quot
to the northwest corner of the floor where truly hoped to find one of the two freight elevators
neither elevator was there
truly pushed the button for the west elevator which operates automatically if the gate is closed
he shouted twice quote turn loose the elevator and quote
when the elevator failed to come baker said quote let's take the stairs and quote and he followed truly up the stairway which is to the west of the elevator
the stairway is located in the northwest corner of the depository building
the stairs from one floor to the next are l shaped with both legs of the l approximately the same length
because the stairway itself is enclosed neither baker nor truly could see anything on the second floor hallway until they reached the landing at the top of the stairs
on the second floor landing there is a small open area with a door at the east end
this door leads into a small vestibule and another door leads from the vestibule into the second floor lunch room
the lunch room door is usually open but the first sdoor is kept shut by a closing mechanism on the door
this vestibule door is solid
except for a small glass window in the upper part of the door
as baker reached the second floor he was about twenty feet from the vestibule door
he intended to continue around to his left toward the stairway going up
but through the window in the door
he caught a fleeting glimpse of a man
walking in the vestibule toward the lunch room
since the vestibule door is only a few feet from the lunch room door the man must have entered the vestibule only a second or two before baker arrived at the top of the stairwell
yet he must have entered the vestibule door before truly reached the top of the stairwell since truly did not see him
if the man had passed from the vestibule into the lunch room
baker could not have seen him
baker said quote
he truly had already started around the bend to come to the next elevator going up
i was coming out this one on the second floor and i don't know i was kind of sweeping this area as i come up
i was looking from right to left
and as i got to this door here i caught a glimpse of this man just you know a sudden glimpse and it looked to me like he was going away from me
i can't say whether he had gone on through that door the lunch room drawer or not
all i did was catch a glance at him and evidently he was this door might have been you no closing and almost shut at that time
and quote
with his revolver drawn
baker opened the vestibule door and ran into the vestibule
he saw a man walking away from him in the lunch room
baker stopped at the door of the lunch room and commanded quote come here and quote
the man turned and walked back toward baker
he had been proceeding toward the rear of the lunch room
along a side wall of the lunch room was a soft drink vending machine
but at that time the man had nothing in his hands
meanwhile truly had run up several steps toward the third floor
missing baker he came back to find the officer in the doorway to the lunch room facing le harvey oswald
baker turned to truly and said quote do you know this man does he work here
and quote
truly replied yes
baker stated later that the man did not seem to be out of breath he seemed calm quote he never did say a word or nothing
in fact he didn't change his expression one bit and qut
truly said of oswald quote he didn't seem to be excited or overly afraid or anything
he might have been a bit startled like i might have been if somebody confronted me
but i cannot recall any change in expression of any kind on his face and quote
truly thought that the officer's gun at that time appeared to be almost touching the middle portion of oswald's body
truly also noted at this time that oswald's hands were empty
in an effort to determine whether oswald could have descended to the lunch room
from the sixth floor by the time baker and truly arrived commissione council asked baker and truly to repeat their movements from the time of the shot
until baker came upon oswald in the lunch room
baker placed himself on a motorcycle about two hundred feet from the corner of elmand houston streets where he said he heard the shots
truly stood in front of the building
at a given signal they reenacted the event
baker's movements were timed with a stop watch
on the first test the elapsed time between the simulated first shot and baker's arrival on the second floor stair landing
was one minute and thirty seconds
the second test run required one minute in fifteen seconds
a test was also conducted to determine the time required to walk from the southeast corner of the sixth floor to the second floor lunch room by stairway
special agent john howlet of the secret service carried a rifle from the southeast corner of the sixth floor along the east isle to the northeast corner
he placed the rifle on the floor near the site where oswald's rifle was actually found after the shooting
then howlett walked down the stairway to the second floor landing and entered the lunch room
the first test run at normal walking pace required one minute eighteen seconds
the second test at a fast walk took one minute fourteen seconds
the second test followed immediately after the first
the only interval was the time necessary to ride in the elevator from the second to the sixth floor
and walked back to the southeast corner
hawlet was not short winded at the end of either test run
the minimum time required by baker to park his motorcycle and reach the second floor lunch room was within three seconds of the time needed to walk
from the southeast corner of the sixth floor down the stairway to the lunch room
the time actually required for baker and truly to reach the second floor on november twenty two was probably longer than in the test runs for example
baker required fifteen seconds after the stimulated shot to ride his motorcycle one hundred eighty to two hundred feet
park it and run forty five feet to the building
no allowance was made for the special conditions which existed on the day of the assassination
possible delayed reaction to the shot jostling with the crowd of people on the steps and scanning the area along elm street and the parkway
baker said quote we stimulated the shots and by the time we got there we did everything that i did that day
and this would be the minimum because i'm sure that i you know it took me a little longer and quote
on the basis of this time test therefore
the commission concluded that oswald could have fired the shots and still have been present in the second floor lunch room when seen by baker and truly
that oswald descended by stairway from the sixth floor to the second floorn lunch room
is consistent with the movements of the two elevators which would have provided the other possible means of descent
when truly accompanied by baker ran to the rear of the first floor
he was certain that both elevators which occupy the same shaft were on the fifth floor
baker not realizing that there were two elevators thought that only one elevator was in the shaft and that it was two or three floors above the second floor
in the few seconds which elapsed while baker and truly ran from the first to the second floor
neither of these slow elevators could have descended from the fifth to the second floor furthermore no elevator was at the second floor when they arrived there
truly an baker continued up the stairs after the encounter with oswald in the lunch room
there was no elevator on the third or fourth floor
the east elevator was on the fifth floor when they arrived
the west elevator was not
they took the east elevator to the seventh floor and ran up a stairway to the roof where they searched for several minutes
jack dardy and employe working on the fifth floor
testified that he took the west elevator to the first floor after hearing a noise which sounded like a backfire
eddie piper the janitor told daroty that the president had been shot
but in his testimony piper did not mention either seeing or talking with doroty during these moments of excitement
both darty and piper were confused witnesses they had no exact memory of the events of that afternoon
truly was probably correct in stating that the west elevator was on the fifth floor when he looked up the elevator shaft from the first floor
the west elevator was not on the fifth floor when baker and truly reached that floor
probably because jack doredy took it to the first floor while baker and truly were running up the stairs or in the lunch room with oswald
neither elevator could have been used by oswald as a means of descent
oswald's use of the stairway is consistent with the testimony of other employees in the building
three employees james jarmon junior
harold norman
and body ray williams were watching the parade from the fifth floor directly below the window from which the shots were fired
they rushed to the west windows after the shots were fired and remained there
until after they saw patrolman baker's white helmet on the fifth floor moving toward the elevator
while they were at the west windows their view of the stairwell was completely blocked by shelves and boxes
this is the period during which oswald would have descended the stairs in all likelihood
dorety took the elevator down from the fifth floor after jarman norman and williams ran to the west windows and were deciding what to do
none of these three men saw dority probably because of the anxiety of the moment and because of the books which may have blocked the view
neither jarman norman williams or darty saw oswald
victoria adams who worked on the fourth floor of the depository building
claimed that within about one minute following the shots she ran from a window on the south side of the fourth floor
down the rear stairs to the first floor where she encountered two depository employees william shelley and billie lovelady
if her estimate of time is correct she reached the bottom of the stairs before truli and baker started up
and she must have run down the stairs ahead of oswald and would probably have seen or heard him
actually she noticed no one on the back stairs
if she descended from the fourth to the first floor as fast as she claimed in her testimony
she would have seen baker or truly on the first floor or on the stairs unless they were already in the second floor lunch room talking to oswald
when she reached the first floor she actually saw shelley and love lady slightly east of the east elevator
shelley and love lady however have testified
that they were watching the parade from the top step of the building entrance when gloria cavally who works in the depository building
ran up and said that the president had been shot
love lady and shelley moved out into the street
about this time shelley saw truly an patrolmand baker go into the building
shelley and lovelady at a fast walk or trot turned west into the railroad yards and then to the west side of the depository building
they re entered the building by the rear door several minutes after baker and truly rushed through the front entrance
on entering love lady saw a girl on the first floor who he believes was victoria adams
if miss adams accurately recalled meeting shewly and love lady when she reached the bottom of the stairs
then her estimate of the time when she descended from the fourth floor is incorrect
and she actually came down stairs several minutes after oswald and after truly and baker as well
oswald's departure from building
within a minute after baker and truly left oswald in the lunch room missus r a reed clerical supervisor for the texas schoolbook depository
saw him walk through the clerical office on the second floor toward the door leading to the front stairway
missus reed had watched the parade from the sidewalk in front of the building with trulie and mister o v campbell vice president of the depository
she testified that she heard three shots which she thought came from the building
she ran inside and up the front stairs into the large open office reserved for clerical employees
as she approached her desk she saw oswald
he was walking into the office from the back hallway
carrying a full bottle of cococola in his hand presumably purchased after the encounter with baker and truly
as oswald passed missus reed she said quote oh the president has been shot but maybe they didn't hit him
and quote
oswald mumbled something and walked by she paid no more attention to him
the only exit from the office in the direction oswald was moving was through the door to the front stairway
missus reed testified that when she saw oswald he was wearing a tea shirt and no jacket
when he left home that morning marina oswald who was still in bed suggested that he wear a jacket
a blue jacket
later identified by marina oswald as her husband was subsequently found in the building apparently left behind by oswald
missus reed believes that she returned to her desk from the street about two minutes after the shooting
reconstructing her movements
missus reed ran the distance three times and was timed in two minutes by stop watch
the reconstruction was the minimum time
accordingly she probably met oswald at about twelve thirty two
approximately thirty to forty five seconds after oswald's lunch room encounter with baker and truly
after leaving missus reed in the front office oswald could have gone down the stairs and out the front door by twelve thirty three p m
three minutes after the shooting
at that time the building had not yet been sealed off by the police
while it was difficult to determine exactly when the police sealed off the building
the earliest estimates would still have permitted oswald to leave the building by twelve thirty three
one of the police officers assigned to the corner of elm and houston streets for the presidential motor caid
w e barnet
testified that immediately after the shot he went to the rear of the building to check the fire escape
he then returned to the corner of elmend heuston
where he met a sergeant who instructed him to find out the name of the building
barnet ran to the building noted its name and then returned to the corner
there he was met by a construction worker
in all likelihood howard brennan who was wearing his work helmet
this worker told barnet that the shots had been fired from a window in the depository building
whereupon barnet posted himself at the front door
to make certain that no one left the building
the sergeant did the same thing at the rear of the building
barnet estimated that approximately three minutes elapsed between the time he heard the last of the shots and the time he started guarding the front door
according to barnet quote there were people going in and out and quote during this period
sergeant d ve harkness of the dabtless police
said that to his knowledge the building was not sealed off at twelve thirty six p m
when he called in on police radio
that a witness amos ewans had seen shots fired from a window of the building
at that time inspector herbert v sawyer's car was parked in front of the building
harkness did not know whether or not two officers with sawyer were guarding the doors
at twelve thirty four p m
sawyer heard a call over the police radio that the shots had come from the depository building
he then entered the building and took the front passenger elevator as far as it would go the fourth floor
after inspecting this floor so your returned to the street about three minutes after he entered the building
after he returned to the street he directed sergeant harkness to station two patrolmen at the front door and not let any one in or out
he also directed that the back door be sealed off
this was no earlier than twelve thirty seven p m and may have been later
special agent forest thee sorrels of the secret service who had been in the motor cave
testified that after driving to parkland hospital
he returned to the depository building about twenty minutes after the shooting
found no police officers at the rear door and was able to enter through this door without identifying himself
although oswald probably left the building at about twelve thirty three p m his absence was not noticed until at least one half hour later
truly who had returned with patrol and baker from the roof saw the police questioning the warehouse employees
approximately fifteen men worked in the warehouse and truly noticed that oswald was not among those being questioned
satisfying himself that oswald was missing
truly obtained oswald's address foe number and description from his employment application card
the address listed was for the pain home in irving
truly gave this information to captain fritz who was on the sixth floor at the time
truly estimated that he gave this information to fritz about fifteen or twenty minutes after the shots
but it was probably no earlier than one twenty two p m the time when the rifle was found
fritz believed that he learned of oswald's absence after the rifle was found
the fact that truly found fritz in the north west corner of the floor near the point where the rifle was found supports fritz's recollection
finger print and palm print evidence establishes that oswald handled two of the four cartains next to the window
and also handled a paper bag which was found near the cartans
oshald was seen in the vicinity of the southeast corner of the sixth floor approximately thirty five minutes before the assassination
and no one could be found who saw oswald anywhere else in the building until after the shooting
an eye witness to the shooting immediately provided a description of the man in the window which was similar to oswald's actual appearance
this witness identified oswald in a line up as the men most nearly resembling the man he saw
and later identified oswald as the man he observed
oswald's known actions in the building immediately after the assassination are consistent with his having been at the southeast corner window of the sixth floor
at twelve thirty p m
on the basis of these findings the commission has concluded that oswald at the time of the assassination
report of the president's commission on the assassination of president kennedy the warn commission report by the president's commission on the assassination of president kennedy
chapter four the assassin part five
the killing of patrolman j d tippet
after leaving the depository building at approximately twelve thirty three p m lee harvey oswald proceeded to his rooming house by bus and taxi
he arrived at approximately one p m
and left a few minutes later
at about one sixteen p m a dallis police officer j d tippet was shocked less than one mile from oswald's rooming house
in deciding whether oswald killed patrol and tippet the commission considered the following
one
positive identification of the killer by two eye witnesses who saw the shooting
and seven eye witnesses who heard the shots and saw the gunman flee the scene with the revolver in his hand
two testimony of firearms identification experts establishing the identity of the murder weapon
three
evidence establishing the ownership of the murder weapon
four evidence establishing the ownership of a zipper jacket
found along the path of flight taken by the gunmen from the scene of the shooting to the place of arrest
oswald's movements after leaving depository building
according to the reconstruction of time and events which the commission found most credible
lee harvey oswald left the building approximately three minutes after the assassination
he probably walked east on elm street for seven blocks to the corner of elm and murphy
where he boarded a bus which was heading back in the direction of the depository building on its way to the oak cliff section of dalis
when oswald was apprehended a bust transfer marked for the lakewood marcallus wrote was found in his shirt pocket
the transfer was dated friday november twenty two sixty three and was punched in two places by the bus driver
on the basis of this punch mark which was distinctive to each dawless driver
the transfer was conclusively identified as having been issued by cecil j mick waters
a bus driver for the dallest transit company
on the basis of the date and time on the transfer mac waters was able to testify that the transfer had been issued by him
on a trip which passed a check point at saint paul and elm street at twelve thirty six p m november twenty two nineteen sixty three
mac quaters was sure that he left the check point on time
and he estimated that it took him three to four minutes to drive three blocks west from the check point to field street
which he reached at about twelve forty p m
mac water's recollection is that he issued this transfer to a man who entered his bus just beyond field street
where a man beat on the front door of the buss boarded it and paid his fare
about two blocks later a woman asked to get off to make a one o'clock train at union station
and requested a transfer which she might use if she got through the traffic
so i gave her a transfer and opened the door and she was going out the gentlemen i had picked up about two blocks back
asked for a transfer and got off at the same place in the middle of the block where the lady did
it was the intersection near lamar street it was near poedrus at lamar street
the man was on the bus approximately four minutes
at about six thirty p m on the day of the assassination mac waters viewed four men in a police liner
he picked oswald from the linup asd the man who had boarded the bust at the quo lower end of town on elm around houston and quote
and who during the ride south on marcellus had an argument with a woman passenger
in his commissioned testimony mac water said he had been in error and that a ta ajor named milton jones was the passenger he had in mind
in a later interview
jones confirmed that he had exchanged words with a woman passenger on the bus during the ride south on marcellis
mec quaters also remembered that a man received a transfer at lamar and elm street and that a man in the line up was about the size of this man
however mac water's recollection alone was too vague to be a basis for placing oswald on the bus
riding on the bus was an elderly woman mary bledso who confirmed the mute evidence of the transfer
oswald had rented a room from missus blood so about six weeks before on october seventh
but she had asked him to leave at the end of a week
missus bladso told him quote i am not going to rent to you any more and quote
she testified quoth i didn't like his attitude there was just something about him i didn't like or want him just didn't want him around me and quote
on november twenty two missus bledzo came downtown to watch the presidential motor cad
she boarded the marsalles bush at saint paul and elm streets to return home
she testified further quote
and after we got past achored at murphy i figured it out let's see i don't know for sure
oswald got on he looks like a maniac his sleeve was out here his shirt was undone
was a hole in it hoe
and he was dirty and i didn't look at him
i didn't want to know i even seen him
he looked so bad in his face and his face was so distorted
hull in his sleeve right here
and quote
as missus bladso said these words she pointed to her right elbow
when oswald was arrested in the texas theatre he was wearing a brown sport shirt with a hole in the right sleep at the elbow
missus bladso identified the shirt as the one oswald was wearing and she stated she was certain that it was oswald who boarded the bus
missus bloodso recalled that oswald sat half way to the rear of the bus which moved slowly and intermittently as traffic became heavy
she heard a passing motorist tell the driver that the president had been shot
people on the bus began talking about it as the bus neared lamar street oswald left the bus and disappeared into the crowd
the marcellus bus which oswald boarded travelled rout west on elm
south on heuston and southwest across the houston viaduct to serve ace the oak cliff area along marcallus
a beckley bus which also served the oak cliff area
followed the same route as the marcellus bus through downtown dalise except that it continued west on elm
across houston in front of the depository building past the triple underpass into westdalis and south on beckley
marcalus street is seven blocks from beckley
oswald lived at ten twenty six north beckley
he could not reach his rooming house on the marcallus bus but the beckley bus stapped across the street
according to mick waters the beckley bus was behind the marcalus bus but he did not actually see it
both buses stopped within one block of the depository building
instead of waiting there oswald apparently went as far away as he could and boarded the first oak cliff bus which came along
rather than wait for the one which stopped across the street from his rooming house
in a reconstruction of this bust trip agents of the secret service and the f be i walked the seven blocks from the front entrance of the depository building
to murphy and elm three times averaging six point five minutes for the three trips
a bus moving through heavy traffic on elm from murphy to lamar was timed at four minutes
if oswald left the depository building at twelve thirty three p m
walked to seven blocks directly to murphy and elm and boarded a bus almost immediately
he would have boarded the bus at approximately twelve forty p m and left it at approximately twelve forty four p m
roger d craig a deputy sheriff of dallas county
claimed that about fifteen minutes after the assassination he saw a man whom he later identified as oswald
coming from the direction of the depository building and running down the hill north of elm street
toward a light colored rambler station wagon which was moving slowly along elm toward the under pass
the station wagon stopped to pick up the man and then drove off
kraig testified that later in the afternoon he saw oswald in the police interrogation room
and told captain fritz that oswald was the man he saw
craig also claimed that when fritz pointed out to oswald that craig had identified him
oswald rose from his chair looked directly at fritz and said
qut
everybody will know who i am now
and quote
the commission could not accept important elements of kraig's testimony
captain fritz stated that a deputy sheriff whom he could not identify did ask to see him that afternoon
and told him a similar story to craggs
fritz did not bring him into his office to identify oswald but turned him over to lieutenant baker for questioning
if craig saw oswald that afternoon he saw him through the glass windows of the office
and neither captain fritz nor any other officer can remember that oswald dramatically arose from his chair
and said quote everybody will know who i am now and quote
if oswald had made such a statement captain frixz and others present would probably have remembered it
craig may have seen a person enter a white rambler station wagon fifteen or twenty minutes after the shooting and travel west on elm street
but the commission concluded that this man was not lee harvey oswald
because of the overwhelming evidence that oswald was far away from the building by that time
the taxicab ride
william wayley a taxicab driver told his employer on saturday morning november twenty three
that he recognized oswald from a newspaper photograph as a man whom he had driven to the oak cliff area the day before
notified of waiyley's statement the police brought him to the police station that afternoon
he was taken to the line up room where according to waley five young tea agers all handcuffed together were displayed with oswald
he testified that oswald looked older than the other boys
the police asked him whether he could pick out his passenger from the lina
waley picked oswald
he said quote
you could have picked him out without identifying him by just listening to him
because he was bawling out the policeman telling them it wasn't right to put him in line with these tea najures and all that
and they asked me which one and i told them it was him all right the same man he showed no respect for the policeman
he told them what he thought about them they knew what they were doing and they were trying to railroad him and he wanted his lawyer
raalley believes that oswald's conduct did not aid him in his identification quote because i knew he was the right one as soon as i saw him
wayley's memory of the line up is inaccurate there were four men altogether not six men in the line up with oswald
walley said that oswald was the man under number two
actually oswald was under number three
only two of the men in the line up with oswald were tea agers john t horn aged eighteen was number one
david knacp aged eighteen was number two
late oswald was number three
and daniel luzin aged twenty six was number four
when he first testified before the commission
waley displayed a trip manifest which showed a twelve o'clock trip from trapvice hotel to the continental bust station
unloaded at twelve fifteen p m
a twelve fifteen p m pick up at continental two greyhound unloaded at twelve thirty p m
and pick up from greyhound bus station at twelve thirty p m
unloaded at five hundred north beckley at twelve forty five p m
wailey testified that he did not keep an accurate time record of his trips but recorded them by the quarter hour
and that sometimes he made his entry right after a trip while at other times he waited to record three or four trips
as he unloaded his continental bus station passenger in front of greyhound he started to get out to buy a package of cigarettes
he saw a man walking south on the mar from commerce
the man was dressed in faded blue color khaki work clothes a brown shirt and some kind of work jacket that almost matched his pats
the man asked wuhot may i have the cab and quote and got into the front seat
waly described the ensuing events as follows quote
and about that time an old lady i think she was an old lady i don't remember nothing but her stickin her head down past him in the door and said
driver will you call me a cab down here she had seen him get this cab and she wanted one too
and he opened the door a little bit like he was goin to get out and he said i will let you have this one and she says no the driver can call me one
i asked him where he wanted to go and he said five hundred north backley well i started up
i started to that address and the police cars the sirens was going running criss crossing everywhere just a big uproar in that end of town and i said
what the halle i wonder what the hill is the uproar
an he never said anything so i figured he was one of these people i don't like to talk so i never said any more to
but when i got pretty close to five hundred blocket meches and north beckley which is the five hundred block he said this will do fine and i pulled over to the curb right there
he gave me a dollar bill the trip was ninety five cents
he gave me a dollar bill and didn't say anything just got out and closed the door and walked around the front of the cab over to the other side of the street
east side of the street of course the traffic was moving through there and i put it in gear and moved on as the last i saw of him
wayley was somewhat imprecise as to where he unloaded his passenger
he marked what he thought was the intersection of nechus and beckley on a map of dallis with a large x
he said quote yes sir that is right because that is the five hundred block of north backley and quote
however nechus and beckley do not intersect
netus is within one half block of the rooming house at ten twenty six north beckley where oswald was living
the five hundred block of north beckley is five blocks south of the roaming house
after a review of these inconsistencies in his testimony before the commission walley was interviewed again in dawls
the route of the taxi cab was retraced under the direction of wailey
he directed the driver of the car to a point twenty feet north of the north west corner of the intersection of beckley and neelie
the point at which he said his passenger alighted
this was the seven hundred block of north backley
the elapsed time of the reconstructed run from the greyhound bust station to neelie and beckley was five minutes and thirty seconds by stop watch
the walk from beckley and neelie to ten twenty six north beckley was timed by commission council at five minutes and forty five seconds
wailly testified that oswald was wearing either the grey cipper jacket or the heavy blue jacket
he was in error however
oswald could not possibly have been wearing the blue jacket during the trip with wailey since it was found in the domino room of the depository late in november
moreover missus bladso saw oswald in the bus without a jacket and wearing a shirt with a hole at the elbow
on the other hand wailing identified commission exhibit number one fifty the shirt taken from oswald upon a rest as the shirt his passenger was wearing
he also stated he saw a silver identification bracelet on his passenger's left wrist
oswald was wearing such a bracelet when he was arrested
on november twenty two oswald told captain fritz that he rode a bust to a stop near his home and then walked to his rooming house
when queried the following morning concerning a bust transfer found in his possession at the time of his arrest he admitted receiving it
and when interrogated about a cab ride oswald also admitted that he left the slow moving bus and took a cab to his rooming house
the greyhound bust station at lamare and jackson streets where oswald entered wailey's cab
is three to four short blocks south of lamar and elm if oswald left the bus at twelve forty four p m
and walked directly to the terminal he would have entered the cab at twelve forty seven or twelve forty eight p m
if the cab ride was approximately six minutes as was the reconstructed ride
he would have reached his destination at approximately twelve fifty four p m
if he was discharged at neelie and beckley and walked directly to his rooming house
he would have arrived there about twelve fifty nine to one p m
from the five hundred block of north beckley the walk would be a few minutes longer
but in either event he would have been in the rooming house at about one p m
this is the approximate time he entered the rooming house according to earline roberts the housekeeper there
arrival and departure from rooming house
earlin roberts housekeeper for missus a c johnson at ten twenty six north beckley
newly harvey oswald under the alias of o h lee
she first saw him the day he rented a room at that address on october fourteenth nineteen sixty three
he signed his name as o h lee on the rooming house register
missus roberts testified that on thursday november twenty one oswald did not come home
on friday november twenty two about one p m he entered the house in unusual haste
she recalled that it was subsequent to the time the president had been shot
after a friend had called and told her president kennedy has been shot she turned on the television
when oswald came in she said quote oh you are in a hurry and quote but oswald did not respond
he hurried to his room and stayed no longer than three or four minutes
oswald had entered the house in his shirt sleeves but when he left he was dipping up a jacket
missus roberts saw him a few seconds later standing near the bustop in front of the house on the east side of beckley
oswald was next seen about nine tenths of a mile away
at the southeast corner of tenth street and patent avenue moments before the tippet shooting
if oswald left his rooming house shortly after one p m and walked at a brisk pace
he would have reached tenth in patent shortly after one fifteen p m
tippits murder was recorded on the police radio tape at about one sixteen p m
description of shooting
petrom and j d tippet joined the dallist police department in july nineteen fifty two
he was described by chief curry as having the reputation of being a very fine dedicated officer
tipic patrolled district number seventy eight in the oak cliff area of dalis during daylight hours
he drove a police car painted distinctive colors with number ten prominently displayed on each side
tippet rode alone as only one man was normally assigned to a patrol car in residential areas during daylight shifts
at about twelve forty four p m on november twenty two
the radio dispatcher on channel one
ordered all downtown patrol squads to report to elman heuston code three emergency
at twelve forty five p m the dispatcher ordered number seventy eight tippet to quote move into central oak cliff area and quote
at twelve fifty four p m tippet reported that he was in the central oak cliff area at lancaster and ace
the dispatcher ordered tippet to be quote at large for any emergency that comes in and quote
according to chief curry tip it was free to patrol the central oak cliff area
tipic must have heard the description of the suspect wanted for the president's shooting it was broadcast over channel one at twelve forty five p m
again at twelve forty eight p m and again at twelve fifty five p m
the suspect was described as a quote
white mail approximately thirty slender build height five foot ten inches weight one hundred sixty five pounds and quote
a similar description was given on channel two at twelve forty five p m
at approximately one fifteen p m tippet who was cruising east on tenth street
past the intersection of tenth and patten about eight blocks from where he had reported at twelve fifty four p m
about one hundred feet past the intersection tippet stopped a man walking east along the south side of patten
the man's general description was similar to the one broadcast over the police radio
tippet stopped the man and called him to his car
he approached the car and apparently exchanged words with tippet through the right front or vent window
tipit got out and started to walk around the front of the car
as tippet reached the left front wheel the man pulled out a revolver and fired several shots
four bullets hit tippet and killed him instantly

eye witnesses
at least twelve persons saw the man with the revolver in the vicinity of the tippit crime scene at or immediately after the shooting
by the evening of november twenty two five of them had identified lee harvey oswald in police lineups as the men they saw
a six did so the next day
three others subsequently identified oswald from a photograph
two witnesses testified that oswald resembled the man they had seen
one wiakness felt he was too distant from the gunment to make a positive identification
a taxi driver
william scoggins
was eating lunch in his cab which was parked on patten facing the southeast corner of ten street and patent avenue a few feet to the north
a police car moving east on tenth at about ten or twelve miles an hour passed in front of his cab
about one hundred feet from the corner
the police car pulled up alongside a man on the sidewalk
this man dressed in a light colored jacket approached the car
scoggins lost sight of him behind some shrubbery on the southeast corner lot
but he saw the policeman leave the car heard three or four shots and then saw the policeman fall
scocgins hurriedly left his seat and hid behind the cab as the man came back toward the corner with gun in hand
the man cut across the yard through some bushes passed within twelve feet of scoggins and ran south on patten
skogins saw him and heard him mutter either poor damned copp or poor dumb cock
the next day scoggins viewed to line up of four persons and identified oswald as the man whom he had seen the day before at tenth in patten
in his testimony before the commission
scoggins stated that he thought he had seen a picture of oswald in the newspapers prior to the line of identification on saturday
he had not seen oswald ontelevision and had not been shown any photographs of oswald by the police
another witness domingo benevides was driving a pick up truck west on tenth street
as he crossed the intersection a block east of temt and patten he saw a policeman standing by the left door of the police car parked along the south side of tenth
benevides saw a man standing at the right side of the parked police car he then heard three shots and saw the policeman fall to the ground
by this time the pick up truck was across the street and about twenty five feet from the police car
benevides stopped and waited in the truck until the gunmen ran to the corner
he saw him empty the gun and throw the shells into some bushes on the southeast corner lot
it was benevites using tippets car radio who first reported the killing of patrol and tippet at about one sixteen p m
quote we've had a shooting out here and quote
he found two empty shells in the bushes and gave them to patrol man j m po who arrived on the scene shortly after the shooting
benevides never saw oswald after the arrest
when questioned by police officers on the evening of november twenty two benevides told them that he did not think that he could identify the man who fired the shots
as a result they did not take him to the police station
he testified that the picture of oswald which he saw later on television bore a resemblance to the man who shot officer tippet
just prior to the shooting missus helen markham a waitress in downtown dalis was about to cross ten street at paten
as she waited on the northwest corner of the intersection for traffic to pass she noticed a young man as he was quote almost ready to get up on the curb and quote
at the southeast corner of the intersection approximately fifty feet away
the man continued along tenth street missus markham saw a police car slowly approached the man from the rear and stop alongside of him
she saw the man come to the right window of the police car
as he talked he leaned on the ledge of the right window with his arms
the man appeared to step back as the policeman quote calmly opened the car door and quote and very slowly got out and walked toward the front of the car
the man pulled a gun missus markham heard three shots and saw the policemen fall to the ground near the left front wheel
she raised her hands to her eyes as the man started to walk back toward patten
she peered through her fingers lowered her hands and saw the man doing something with his gud quote
he was just fooling with it i didn't know what he was doing i was afraid he was fixing to kill me
and quote
the man quote in kind of a little trot and quote headed down patten toward jefferson boulevard a block away
missus markham then ran to officer tippit's side and saw him lying in a pool of blood
helen markham was screaming as she leaned over the body
a few minutes later she described the government to a policeman
her description and that of other eye witnesses led to the police broadcast at one twenty two p m
describing the slayer as quote about thirty five foot eight inches black hair slender and quot
at about four thirty p m missus markham
who had been greatly upset by her experience was able to view a line up bafore men handcuffed together at the police station
she identified le harvey oswald as the man who shot the policeman
detective l c graves who had been with missus markham before the line up
testified that she was quote quite hysterical and quote and was quote crying and upset and quote
he said that missus markham started crying when oswald walked into the line op room
in testimony before the commission missus markham confirmed her positive identification of lea harvey oswald
as the man she saw kill officer tippet
in evaluating missus markham's identification of oswald the commission considered certain allegations
that missus markham described the man who killed patrol and tippet as quote short a little on the heavy side and quote
and having quote somewhat bushy and quote hair
the commission reviewed the transcript of a phone conversation in which missus markham is alleged to have provided such a description
a review of the complete transcript has satisfied the commission
that missus markham strongly reaffirmed her positive identification of oswald and denied having described the killer
as short stocky and having bushy hair she stated that the man weighed about one hundred fifty pounds
although she used the words quote a little bit bushy and quote to describe the gunman's hair
the transcript establishes that she was referring to the uncombed state of his hair a description fully supported by a photograph of oswald
taken at the time of his arrest
although in the phone conversation she described the man as quote short and quote on november twenty second
within minutes of the shooting and before the line of missus markham described the man to the police as five foot eight inches tall
during her testimony missus markham initially denied that she ever had the above phone conversation
she has subsequently admitted the existence of the conversation and offered an explanation for her denial
addressing itself solely to the promitive value of missus markham's contemporaneous description of the gunmen
and her positive identification of oswald at a police line up the commission considers her testimony reliable
however even in the absence of missus markham's testimony there isample evidence to identify oswald as the killer of tippet
two young women
barbara jeanette davis and virginia davis were in an apartment of a multiple unit house on the southeast corner of tenth and patten
when they heard the sound of gunfire and the screams of helen markham
they ran to the door in time to see a man with a revolver cut across their lawn and disappear around a corner of the house on to paten
barbara jeanette davis assumed that he was emptying his gun as quoat he had it open and was shaking it and quote she immediately called the police
later in the day each woman found an empty shell on the ground near the house these two shells were delivered to the police
on the evening of november twenty two
barbara jeannette and virginia davis viewed a group of four men in a line up and each one picked oswald as the man who crossed their lawn while emptying his pistol
barbara jeanette davis testified that no one had shown her a picture of oswald before the identification and that she had not seen him on television
she was not sure whether she had seen his picture in a newspaper on the afternoon or evening of november twenty two prior to the line up
her reaction when she saw oswald in the line up was that quote
i was pretty sure it was the same man i saw when they made him turn sideways i was positive that was the one i seen and quote
similarly virginia davis had not been shown pictures of any one prior to the line up and had not seen either television or the newspapers during the afternoon
she identified oswald who was the number two men in the line up as the man she saw running with the gun
she testified quote i would say that was him for shore and quote
barbara jgeannette davis and virginia davis were sitting alongside each other when they made their positive identifications of oswald
each woman whispered oswald's number to the detective each testified that she was the first to make the identification
william arthur smith was about a block east of temt and patten when he heard shots
he looked west on tent and saw a man running to the west and a policeman falling to the ground
psmith failed to make himself known to the police on november twenty two
several days later he reported what he had seen and was questioned by f b a agents
psmith subsequently told a commissioned staff member
that he saw oswald on television the knight of the murder and thought that oswald was the man he had seen running away from the shooting
on television oswald's hair looked blond whereas psmith remembered that the man who ran away had hair that was brown or brownish black
later the f eye showed psmith a picture of oswald in the picture the hare was brown
according to his testimony smith told the f be i quote it looked more like him than it did on television and quote
he stated further that from quote what i saw of him and quote the man looked like the man in the picture
two other important eye witnesses to oswald's flight were ted calloway
manager of a used car lot on the northeast corner of patent avenue and jefferson boulevard and sam ginyard a porter at the lot
they heard the sound of shots to the north of their lot galloway heard five shots and guineard three
both ran to the sidewalk on the east side of patten at a point about half a block south of ten
they saw a man coming south on patten with a revolver held high in his right hand
according to calloway the man crossed to the west side of patten
from across the street galloway yelled quote hey man what the hell is going on and quote
he slowed down halted said something and then kept on going to the corner
turned right
and continued west on jefferson
kinyard claimed that the man ran down the east side of patten and passed within ten feet of him before crossing to the other side
gkinyard and galloway ran to temt and patten and found tippet lying in the street beside his car
apparently he had reached for his gun it lay beneath him outside of the holster
galloway picked up the gun
he and scoggins attempted to chase down the gunment in scotgan's taxi cab
but he had disappeared
early in the evening of november twenty two
ginyard and galloway viewed the same line up before men from which missus markham had earlier made her identification of le harvey oswald
both men picked oswald as the man who had run south on patten with a gun in his hand
galloway told the commission
quote so they brought four men in
i stepped to the back of the room so i could kind of see him from the same distance which i had seen him before and when he came out i knew him and quote
kinyard said quote i told them that was him right there i pointed him out right there and quote
both galloway and ginyard testified that they had not been shown any pictures by the police before the linep
the dalless police department furnished the commission with pictures of the men who appeared in the line ups with oswald
and the commission has inquired into general line of procedures used by the daoliss police as well as the specific procedures in the line ups involving oswald
the commission is satisfied that the linaps were conducted fairly
as oswald ran south on patent avenue toward jefferson boulevard he was moving in the direction of a used carlot
located on the southeast corner of this intersection
four men warran reynolds harold russell pat patterson and l jane lewis
were on the lot at the time and they saw a white mail with a revolver in his hands running south on patten
when the man reached jefferson he turned right and headed west
reynolds and patterson decided to follow him
when he reached a gasolene service station one block away he turned north and walked toward a parking area in the rear of the station
neither reynolds nor patterson saw the man after he turned off jefferson at the service station
these four witnesses were interviewed by f b a agents two months after the shooting
russell and patterson were shown a picture of oswald and they stated that oswald was the man they saw on november twenty two nineteen sixty three
russell confirmed this statement in a sworn affidavit for the commission
patterson when asked later to confirm his identification by affidavit said he did not recall having been shown the photograph
he was then shown two photographs of oswald and he advised that oswald was quote unquestionably and quote the man he saw
reynolds did not make a positive identification when interviewed by the f be i but
he subsequently testified before a commissioned staff member and when shown two photographs of oswald
stated that they were photographs of the men he saw
l j lewis said in an interview that because of the distance from which he observed the gunmen he would hesitate to state whether the man was identical with oswald
when oswald was arrested he had in his possession a smith and wesson thirty eight special calibre revolver
serial number v five one zero to one zero
two of the arresting officers placed their initials on the weapon and a third inscribed his name
all three identified exhibit number one forty three as the revolver taken from oswald when he was arrested
four cartridge cases were found in the shrubbery
on the corner of tentand patten
by three of the eye witnesses
to mingle beneviedes
barbara jeanette davis and virginia davis
it was the unanimous and unequivocal testimony of expert witnesses before the commission that these used cartridge cases were fired from the revolver
in oswald's possession to the exclusion of all other weapons
cortland cunningham of the firearm's identification unit of the f behind laboratory testified
that he compared the four empty cartridge cases found near the scene of the shooting with a test cartridge fired from the weapon in oswald's possession when he was arrested
cunningham declared that this weapon fired the four cartridges to the exclusion of all other weapons
identification was effected through breech face marks and firing pin marks
robert a fraser and charles killion other f b i firearms experts
independently examined the four cartridge cases and arrived at the same conclusion as cunningham
at the request of the commission joseph d nicholl
superintendent of the illinois bureau of criminal identification investigation
also examined the four cartridge cases found near the sight of the homicide and compared them with the test cartridge cases fired from the smith and wesson revolver
taken from oswald
he concluded that all these cartridges were fired from the same weapon
cunningham compared four leag bullets recovered from the body of patrom and tippet with cest bullets fired from oswald's revolver
he explained that the bullets were slightly smaller than the barrel of the pistol which had fired them
this caused the bullets to have an erratic passage through the barrel
and impressed upon the lead of the bullets inconsistent individual characteristics which made identification impossible
consecutive bullets fired from the revolver by the f beyind experts could not be identified as having been fired from that revolver
cunningham testified that all of the bullets were mutilated one being useless for comparison purposes
all four bullets were fired from a weapon
with five lands and grooves and a righte twist which were the rifling characteristics of the revolver taken from oswald
he concluded however that he could not say whether the four bullets were fired from the revolver in oswald's possession
quote the only thing i can testify
is they could have
on the basis of the rifling characteristics they could have been
and quote
nicholl differed with the f pi i experts on one bullet taken from tippet's body
he declared that this bullet was fired from the same weapon that fired the test bullets to the exclusion of all other weapons
but he agreed that because the other three bullets were mutilated he could not determine if they had been fired from the same weapon as the test bullets
the examination and testimony of the experts enabled the commission to conclude that five shots may have been fired
even though only four bullets were recovered
three of the bullets recovered from tipet's body were manufactured by winchester western and the fourth bullet by remington peters
but only two of the four discarded cartridge cases found on the lawn at tenth street and patent avenue were of winchester western manufacture
therefore one cartridge case of this type was not recovered
and though only one bullet of remington peter's manufacture was recovered two empty cartridge cases of that make were retrieved
therefore either one bullet of remington peter's manufacture is missing
or one used remington peter's cartridge case which may have been in the revolver before the shooting
was discarded along with the others as oswald left the scene
if a bullet is missing five were fired
this corresponds with the observation and memory of ted calloway and possibly war in reynolds
but not with the other eye witnesses who claim to have heard from two to four shots
ownership of revolver
by checking certain importers and dealers after the assassination of president kennedy and slaying of officer tippet
agents of the f be i determined that george rose and company of los angeles was a major distributor of this type of revolver

the signature of the witness d ef rittle
who attested that the fictitious hadel was an american citizen and had not been convicted of a felony was also in oswald's handwriting
marina oswald gave as her opinion that the mail order cupon was in oswald's handwriting
when shown the revolver she stated that she recognized it as the one owned by her husband
she also testified that this appeared to be the revolver seen in oswald's belt
in the picture she took in late march or early april nineteen sixty three when the family was living on neelie street in dawlis
police found an empty revolver holster when they searched oswald's room on beckley avenue after his arrest
marina oswald testified that this was the holster which contained the revolver in the photographs taken on neelie street
oswald jacket
approximately fifteen minutes before the shooting of tippet oswald was seen leaving his rooming house
he was wearing a zipper jacket which he had not been wearing moments before when he had arrived home
when oswald was arrested he did not have a jacket
shortly after tippit was slain policemen found a light colored zipper jacket along the route taken by the killer as he attempted to escape
at one twenty two p m
the dallest police radio described the man wanted for the murder of tippet as quote
a white mail about thirty
five foot eight inches black hair slender
wearing a white jacket white shirt
and dark slacks and qut
according to patrol and po
this description came from missus markham
and missus barber jeannette davis
missus markham told po
that the man was a quote white mail about twenty five
about five feet eight
brown hair
medium and quote and wearing equote
white jacket and quot
missus davis gave po the same general description
he quote white mail at his early twenties around five for seven inches
or eight inches about one hundred forty five pounds and quot and wearing a white jacket
as has been discussed previously
two witnesses warren reynolds and b m patterson
saw the gunman run toward the rear of a gasolene service station on jefferson boulevard
missus mary brock
the wife of a mechanic who worked at the station
was there at the time and she saw a white mail
five feet ten inches wearing light clothing
a light colored jacket
walked past her at a fast pace with his hands in his pocket
she last saw him in the parking lot directly behind the service station
when interviewed by f  i agents on january twenty one nineteen sixty four
she identified a picture of oswald as being the same person she saw on november twenty two
she confirmed this interview by a sworn affidavit
at one twenty four p m
the police radio reported quote
the suspect last seen running west on jefferson from four hundred east jefferson
least captain w r westbrook and several other officers concentrated their search
along jefferson boulevard
westbrook walked through the parking lock behind the service station and found a light colored jacket
lying under the rear of one of the cars
westbrook identified commission exhibit number one sixty two as the light colored jacket which he discovered underneath the automobile
this jacket belonged to lee harvey oswald
marina oswald stated that her husband owned only two jackets one blue and the other grey
the blue jacket was found in the texas schoolbook depository and was identified by marina oswald as her husband
marina oswald also identified commission exhibit number one sixty two the jacket found by captain westbrook
as her husband's second jacket
the eye witnesses vary in their identification of the jacket
missus erline roberts the housekeeper at oswald's rooming house and the last person known to have seen him before he reached ten street and patent avenue
said that she may have seen the gray zipper jacket
but she was not certain
it seemed to her that the jacket oswald wore was darker than commission exhibit number one sixty two
ted galloway
who saw the gunmen moments after the shooting
testified at
commission exhibit number one sixty two
looked like the jacket he was wearing but quote
i thought it had a little more tan to it and quote
two other witnesses sam ginniard and william arthur smith
testified that commission exhibit number one sixty two was the jacket worn by the man they saw on november twenty two
missus markham and barbara davis thought that the jacket worn by the slayer of tippet
was darker than the jacket found by westbrook
scoggins thought it was lighter
there is no doubt however that oswald was seen leaving his rooming house at about one p m
wearing a zipper jacket
that the man who killed tippet was wearing a light colored jacket
that he was seen running along jefferson boulevard
that a jacket was found under a car in a lot adjoining jefferson boulevard
that the jacket belonged to lee harvey oswald and that when he was arrested at approximately one fifty p m
he was in short sleeves
these facts warrant the finding that lee harvey oswald disposed of his jacket as he fled from the scene of the tippet killing
the foregoing evidence establishes that
one
two eye witnesses who heard the shots and saw the shooting of dalis police patrom and j d tippett
and seven eye witnesses who saw the flight of the gunmen with a revolver in hand
positively identified lee harvey oswald as the man they sought fire the shots or flee from the scene
two the cartridge cases found near the scene of the shooting
were fired from the revolver in the possession of oswald at the time of his arrest
to the exclusion of all other weapons
three
the revolver in oswald's possession at the time of his arrest
was purchased by and belonged to oswald and four
oswald's jacket was found along the path of flight
taken by the gunmen as he fled from the scene of the killing

aswald's arrest
the texas theatre is on the north side of jefferson boulevard approximately eight blocks from the scene of the tippet shooting and six blocks
from where several witnesses last saw oswald running west on jefferson boulevard shortly after the tipic murder
police sirens sounded along jefferson beaulevard
one of the persons who heard the sirens was johnny calvin brewer manager of heartsease shoe store a few doors east of the texas theatre
brewer knew from radio broadcasts that the president had been shot
and that a patrol men had also been shot in oak cliff
when he heard police sirens he quote looked up and saw the man enter the lobby and quote
a recess area extending about fifteen feet between the sidewalk and the front door of his store
a police car made a yew turn and as the sirens grew fainter
the man in the lobby quote looked over his shoulder and turned round and walked up west jefferson towards the theatr and quote
the man wore a tea shirt beneath his outer shirt and he had no jacket
brewer said quote he just looked funny to me his hair was sort of mestop
and looked like he had been running and he looked scared and he looked funny and quo
missus julia postal selling tickets at the box office of the texas theatre
heard police sirens and then saw a man as he quote ducked into and quote the outer lobby space of the theatre near the ticket office
attracted by the sound of the sirens missus postal stepped out of the box office and walked to the curb
shortly thereafter johnny brewer who had come from the nearby shoe store asked missus postal whether the fellow that had ducked in had bought a ticket
she said quote no by golly he didn't and quote and turned round but the man was nowhere in sight
brewer told missus postal
that he had seen the man ducking into his place of business and that he had followed him to the theatr
she sent brewer into the theatre to find the man and check the exits told him about the assassination and said quote
i don't know if this is the man they want but he is running from them for some reason
and quote
she then called the police
at one forty five p m the police radio stated quote have information a suspect just went in the texas theatre on west jefferson and quote
patrol cars bearing at least fifteen officers converged on the texas theatre
patrol men m n mc donald with patrol men r hawkins t a hudson and c t walker entered the theatre from the rear
other policemen entered the front door and searched the balcony
detective paul l bentley rushed to the balcony and told the projectionist to turn up the houselights
brewer met mac donald and the other policeman at the alley exit door
stepped out on to the stage with them
and pointed out the man who had come into the theatre without paying
the man was oswald he was sitting alone in the rear of the main floor of the theatre near the right centre aisle
about six or seven people were seated on the theatre's main floor and an equal number in the balcony
mac donald first searched two men in the centre of the main floor about ten rows from the front
he walked out of the row up the right centre aisle
when he reached the row where the suspect was sitting mc donald stopped abruptly and told the man to get on his feet
oswald rose from his seat bringing up both hands
as mc donald started to search oswald's waiste for a gun he heard him say quote well it's all over now
and quote
oswald then struck mac donald between the eyes with his left fist with his right hand he drew a gun from his waist
mac donald struck back with his right hand and grabbed the gun with his left hand they both fell into the seats
three other officers moving toward the scuffle grabbed oswald from the front rear and side
as mc donald fell into the seat with his left hand on the gun he felt something graze across his hand and heard what sounded like the snap of the hammer
mc donald felt the pistol scratch his cheek as he wrenched it away from oswald
detective bob k carroll who was standing beside mac donald seized the gun from him
the other officers who helped subdue oswald corroborated mac donald in his testimony
except that they did not hear oswald say quote it's all over now and quote
deputy sheriff edy r walters recalled such a remark but he did not reach the scene of the struggle
until oswald had been knocked to the floor by mac donald than the others
some of the officers saw oswald strike mac donald with his fist most of them heard a click which they assumed to be a click of the hammer of the revolver
testimony of a firearms expert before the commission established that the hammer of the revolver never touched the shell in the chamber
although the witnesses did not hear the sound of a misfire
they might have heard a snapping noise resulting from the police officer grabbing the cylinder of the revolver and pulling it away from oswald while he was attempting to pull the trigger
two patrons of the theatre and john brewer
testified regarding the arrest of oswald as did the various police officers who participated in the fight
george jefferson aplin junior confirmed that oswald fought with four or five officers before he was handcuffed
he added that one officer grabbed the muzzle of a shotgun drew back and hit oswald with the butt end of the gun in the back
no other theatre patron or officer has testified that oswald was hit by a gun
nor did oswald ever complain that he was hit with a gun or injured in the back
deputy sheriff walters brought a shotgun into the theatre but laid it on some seats before helping subdue oswald
officer ray hawkins said
that there was no one near oswald who had a shotgun and he saw no one strike oswald in the back with a rifle butt or the butt of a gun
john gibson another patron in the theatre saw an officer grab oswald and he claims that he heard the click of a gun mespiring
he saw no shotgun in the possession of any policeman near oswald
johnny brewer testified he saw oswald pull the revolver and the officers struggled with him to take it away
but that once he was subdued no officer struck him
he further stated that while fists were flying he heard one of the officers say quote
kill the president will you
and quote
it is unlikely that any of the police officers referred to oswald as a suspect in the assassination
while the police radio had noted the similarity and description of the two suspects the arresting officers were pursuing oswald for the murder of tippett
as oswald handcuffed was led from the theatr he was according to mac donald quote
cursing a little bit and hollering police brutality and quote
at one fifty one p m police cart too reported by radio that it was on the way two headquarters with the suspect
captain fritz returned to police headquarters from the texas schoolbook depository at two fifteen after a brief stop at the sheriff's office
when he entered the homicide an robbery bureau office he saw two detectives standing there with sergeant gerald l hill
who had driven from the theatre with oswald
ill testified that fritz told the detective to get a search warrant go to an address on fifth street and irving
and pick up a man named le oswald when hale asked why oswald was wanted
fritz replied quote well he was employed down at the book depository and he had not been present for a roll call of the employees and quote
hale said quit
captain
we will save you a trip there he sits and quote
statements of oswald during detention
oswald was questioned intermittently for approximately twelve hours between two thirty p m on november twenty two and eleven a m
on november twenty fourth
throughout this interrogation he denied that he had anything to do either with the assassination of president kennedy or the murder of patrol and tippet
captain fritz of the homicide and robbery bureau did most of the questioning but he kept no notes and there were no stenographic or taprcordings
representatives of other law enforcement agencies were also present including the f b i and the u s secret service
they occasionally participated in the questioning
the reports prepared by those present at these interviews are set forth in appendix eleven
a full discussion of oswald's detention and interrogation is presented in chapter five of this report
during the evening of november twenty two the daolist police department performed paraffin tests on oswald's hands and right cheek
in an apparent effort to determine by means of a scientific test whether oswald had recently fired a weapon
the results were positive for the hands and negative for the right cheek
expert testimony before the commission
was to the effect that the paraffin test was unreliable in determining whether or not a person has fired a rifle or revolver
the commission has therefore placed no reliance on the paraffin tests administered by the dalliss police
oswald provided little information during his questioning
frequently however he was confronted with evidence which he could not explain and he resorted to statements which are known to be lies
while oswald's untrue statements during interrogation were not considered items of positive proof
by the commission they had probitive value in deciding the weight to be given to his denials that he assassinated president kennedy
and killed pertrol and tippet since independent evidence revealed that oswald repeatedly and blatantly lied to the police
the commission gave little weight to his denials of guilt
denial of rifle ownership
from the outset oswald denied owning a rifle
on november twenty three fritz confronted oswald with the evidence that he had purchased a rifle under the fictitious name of hidel
oswald said that this was not true oswald denied that he had a rifle wrapped up in a blanket in the pained garage
oswald also denied owning a rifle and said that since leaving the marine core he had fired only a small boar twenty two rifle
on the afternoon of november twenty three officers h m moore
r s stobl and g f rose obtained a search warrant and examined oswald's effects in the pain garage
they discovered two photographs each showing oswald with a rifle and a pistol
these photographs were shown to oswald on the evening of november twenty three
and again on the morning of the twenty fourth
according to fritz oswald sneered saying that they were fake photographs that he had been photographed a number of times the day before by the police
that they had superimposed upon the photographs a rifle and a revolver he told fritz a number of times that the smaller photograph
was either made from the larger or the larger photograph was made from the smaller and that at the proper time he would show that the pictures were fakes
fritz told him that the two small photographs were found in the paine garage
at that point oswald refused to answer any further questions
as previously indicated marina oswald testified that she took the two pictures with her husband's imperial reflex camera
when they lived on neelie street
her testimony was fully supported by a photography expert who testified that in his opinion the pictures were not composites
at the first interrogation oswald claimed that his only crime was carrying a gun and resisting arrest
when captain fritz asked him why he carried the revolver he answered quote well you know about a pistol i just carried it and quote
he falsely alleged that he bought the revolver in fortworth when in fact he purchased it from a mail order house in los angeles
the aliases hidel and o h lee
the arresting officers found a forged selective service card with a picture of oswald and the name alec j hidel
in oswald's billfold on november twenty two and twenty three oswald refused to tell fritz why this card was in his possession
or to answer any questions concerning the card
on sunday morning november twenty fourth oswald denied that he knew a j hidel
captain fritz produced the selective service card bearing the name alec j hidel
oswald became angry and said quote
now i've told you all i'm going to tell you about that card and my billfolds you have the card yourself and you know as much about it as i do and quote
at the last interrogation in november oswald admitted to postal inspector holmes that he had rented post office box two nine one five dollars
but denied that he had received a package in this box addressed to herdel
he also denied that he had received the rifle through this box
holmes reminded oswald that a j hadel was listed on post office box three zerosiro six one new orleans
as one entitled to receive mail
oswald replied quoth i don't know anything about that and quote
when asked why he lived at his rooming house under the name o h lee
oswald responded that the landlady simply made a mistake
because he told her that his name was lee
meaning his first name
an examination of the rooming house register revealed that oswald actually signed the name o h lee
the curtainrod story
in concluding that oswald was carrying a rifle in the paper bag on the morning of november twenty twot nineteen sixty three
the commission found that oswald lied when he told fraser that he was returning to irving to obtain curtain rods
when asked about the curtain rods story oswald lied again
he denied that he had ever told fraser that he wanted a ride to irving to get curtain rods for an apartment
he explained that a party for the pain children had been planned for the week end and he preferred not to be in the pain house at that time
therefore he made his weekly visit on thursday night
actually the party for one of the pain's children was the preceding weekend when marina oswald suggested that oswald remain endowus
when told that fraser and missus randal had seen him carrying a long heavy package oswald replied quote well they was mistaken
that must have been some other time he picked me up and quote
in one interview he told fritz that the only sack he carried to work that day
was a lunch sack which she kept on his lap during the ride from irving to dalis
fraser testified before the commission that oswald carried no lunch sack that day
actions during and after shooting
during the first interrogation on november twenty two fritz asked oswald to account for himself at the time the president was shot
oswald told him that he ate lunch in the first floor lunch room and then went to the second floor for a coke which he brought downstairs
he acknowledged the encounter with the police officer on the second floor
oswald told fritz that after lunch he went outside talked with forman bills shelley for five or ten minutes and then left for home
he said that he left work because bill shelley said that there would be no more work done that day in the building
shelley denied seeing oswald after twelve noon or at any time after the shooting
the next day oswald added to his story
he stated that at the time the president was shot he was having lunch with junior but he did not give junior's last name
the only employee at the depository building named junior was james jarman junior
jarman testified that he ate his lunch on the first floor around five minutes to twelve and that he neither ate lunch with nor saw oswald
jarman did talk to oswald that morning quote
he asked me what were the people gathering around on the corner for and i told him that the president was supposed to pass that morning
and he asked me did i know which way he was coming and i told him yes he'd probably come down main and turn on euston and then back again on elm
then he said oh i see and that was all
prior attempt to kill
the attempt on the life of major general edwin a walker
at approximately nine p m on april tenth nineteen sixty three in dowos texas major general edwin a walker
an active and controversial figure on the american political scene since his resignation from the u s army in nineteen sixty one
narrowly escaped death when a rifle bullet fired from outside his home passed near his head as he was seated at his desk
there were no eye witnesses although a fourteen year old boy in a neighboring house claimed that immediately after the shooting
he saw two men in separate cars drive out of a church parking lot adjacent to walker's home a friend of walkers testified that
two nights before the shooting he saw quote two men around the house peaking in windows and quote
general walker gave this information to the police before the shooting but it did not help solve the crime
although the bullet was recovered from walker's house in the absence of a weapon it was of little investigatory value
general walker hired two investigators to determine whether a former employee might have been involved in the shooting
their results were negative
until december three nineteen sixty three the walker shooting remained unsolved
the commission evaluated the following evidence in considering whether lee harvey oswald fired the shot which almost killed general walker
a note which oswald left for his wife on the evening of the shooting
two photographs found among oswald's possessions after the assassination of president kennedy
three firearm identification of the bullet found in walker's home and four
admissions and other statements made to marina oswald by oswald concerning the shooting note left by oswald
on december two nineteen sixty three missus ruth payne turned over to the police some of the oswalds belongings
including a russian volume entitled quote book of useful advice and quote in this book was an undated note written in russian
in translation the note read as follows one
this is the key to the mail box which is located in the main post office in the city on ervae street
this is the same street where the drug store in which you always waited is located
you will find the mail box in the post office which is located four blocks from the drug store on that street
i paid for the box last month so don't worry about it
two send the information as to what has happened to me to the embassy
and include newspaper clippings should there be anything about me in the newspapers i believe that the embassy will come quickly to your assistance on learning everything
three i paid the house rent on the second so don't worry about it
four recently i also paid for water and gas
five the money from work will possibly be coming the money will be sent to our post office box go to the bank and cash the check
six you can either throw out or give my clothing et cetera a way do not keep these
however i prefer that you hold on to my personal papers military civil et cetera
seven certain of my documents are in the small blue valise
ten i left you as much money as i could
sixty dollars on the second of the month you and the baby can live for another two months using ten dollars per week
eleven if i am alive and taken prisoner
the city jail is located at the end of the bridge through which we always passed on going to the city right in the beginning of the city after crossing the bridge
james c cadagin f be i handwriting expert testified that this note was written by lee harvey oswald
prior to the walker shooting on april tenth oswald had been attending typing classes on monday tuesday and thursday evenings
he had quit these classes at least a week before the shooting which occurred on a wednesday night
according to marina oswald's testimony on the night of the walker shooting her husband left their apartment on neelie street shortly after dinner
she thought he was attending a class or was on his own business
when he failed to return by ten or ten thirty p m marina oswald went to his room and discovered the note she testified quote
when he came back i asked him what had happened he was very pale
i don't remember the exact time but it was very late and he told me not to ask him any questions he only told me he had shot at general walker
oswald told his wife that he did not know whether he had hit walker
according to marina oswald
when he learned on the radio and in the newspapers the next day that he had missed
he said that he quote was very sorry that he had not hit him and quote marina oswald's testimony was fully supported by the note itself
which appeared to be the work of a man expecting to be killed or imprisoned or to disappear
the last paragraph directed her to the jail
and the other paragraphs instructed her on the disposal of oswald's personal effects and the management of her affairs if he should not return
it is clear that the note was written while the oswalds were living in dalice before they moved two new orleans in the spring of nineteen sixty three
the references to house rent and payments for water and gas
indicated that the note was written when they were living in a rented apartment therefore it could not have been written while marina oswald was living with the panes
moreover the reference in paragraph three to pay in quoth the house rent on the second and quote
would be consistent with the period when the oswalds were living on neelie street since the apartment was rented on march three nineteen sixty three
oswald had paid the first month's rent in advance
on march two nineteen sixty three
and the second month's rent was paid on either april two or april three
the main post office quote on ervae street and quote refers to the post office where oswald rented box two nine one five
from october ninth nineteen sixty two to may fourteenth nineteen sixty three
another statement which limits the time when it could have been written is the reference quote you and the baby and quote
which would indicate that it was probably written before the birth of oswald's second child on october twenty nineteen sixty three
oswald had apparently mistaken the county jail for the city jail
from neelie street the oswalds would have travelled downtown on the beckley bus across the commerce street via duct
and into downtown dalis through the triple underpass
either the viaduct or the under pass might have been the bridge mentioned in the last paragraph of the note
the county jail is at the corner of houston and main streets quote right in the beginning of the city and quote after one travels through the under pass
in her testimony before the commission in february nineteen sixty four
marina oswald stated that when oswald returned home on the night of the walker shooting he told her that he had been planning the attempt for two months
he showed her a note book three days later containing photographs of general walker's home and a map of the area where the house was located
although oswald destroyed the notebook three photographs found among oswald's possessions after the assassination
were identified by marina oswald as photographs of general walker's house
two of these photographs were taken from the rear of walker's house
the commission confirmed by comparison with other photographs that these were indeed photographs of the rear of walker's house
an examination of the window at the rear of the house
the wall through which the bullet passed
and the fence behind the house
indicated that the bullet was fired from a position near the point where one of the photographs was taken
the third photograph identified by marina oswald
depicts the entrance to general walker's driveway from a back alley
also seen in the picture is the fence on which walker's assailant apparently rested the rifle
an examination of certain construction work appearing in the background of this photograph revealed that the picture was taken between march eight
and twelve nineteen sixty three and most probably on either march ninth or march ten
oswald purchased the money oder for the rifle on march twelfth the rifle was shipped on march twenty
and the shooting occurred on april tenth
a photography expert with the f be i
was able to determine that this picture was taken with the imperial reflex camera owned by lee harvey oswald
a fourth photograph showing a stretch of railroad tracks
was also identified by marina oswald as having been taken by her husband presumably in connection with the walker shooting
investigation determined that this photograph was taken approximately seven tenths of a mile from walker's house
another photograph of railroad tracks found among oswald's possessions was not identified by his wife
but investigation revealed that it was taken from a point slightly less than half a mile from general walker's house
marina oswald stated that when she asked her husband what he had done with the rifle
he replied that he had buried it in the ground or hidden it in some bushes and that he also mentioned a railroad track in this connection
she testified that several days later oswald recovered his rifle and brought it back to their apartment
firearms identification
in the room beyond the one in which general walker was sitting on the night of the shooting the dallest police recovered a badly mutilated bullet
which had come to rest on a stack of paper
the dallist city county investigation laboratory tried to determine the type of weapon which fired the bullet
the aural report was negative because of the battered condition of the bullet
on november thirtieth nineteen sixty three the f bi ar requested the bullet for belistic's examination
the dallis police department forwarded it on december two nineteen sixty three
robber a frazer and f be ibalistics identification expert testified that he was quote unable to reach a conclusion and quote
as to whether or not the bullet recovered from walker's house had been fired from the rifle found on the sixth floor of the texas school book depository building
he concluded that quote the general rifling characteristics of the rifle are of the same type as those found on the bullet
and further on this basis the bullet could have been fired from the rifle on the basis of its land and groove impressions and quote
fraser testified further that the f b i avoids the category of probable identification
unless the missile or cartridge case can be identified as coming from a particular weapon to the exclusion of all others
the f b i refuses to draw any conclusion as to probability
frazer testified however that he found no microscopic characteristics or other evidence
which would indicate that the bullet was not fired from the manliquer carcano rifle owned by lee harvey oswald
it was a six point five millimeter bullet
and according to fraser relatively few types of rifles could produce the characteristics found on the bullet
joseph d nicholl
superintendent of the illinois bureau of criminal identification and investigation conducted an independent examination of this bullet
and concluded quote
that there is a fair probability and quote
that the bullet was fired from the rifle used in the assassination of president kennedy
in explaining the difference between his policy and that of the f b i on the matter of probable identification
nicholas said quote
i am aware of their position this is not i am sure arrived at without careful consideration
however to say that because one does not find sufficient marks for identification that it is a negative
i think he's going overboard in the other direction
and for purposes of probitive value for whatever it might be worth
in the absence of very definite negative evidence i think it is permissible to say that in an exhibit such as five seventy three
there is enough on it to say that it could have come and even perhaps a little stronger to say that it probably came from this
without going so far as to say to the exclusion of all other guns this i could not do
and quote
although the commission recognizes that neither expert was able to state
that the bullet which missed general walker was fired from osbald's rifle to the exclusion of all others this testimony was considered probitive
when combined with the other testimony linking oswald to the shooting
additional corroborative evidence
the admissions made to marina oswald by her husband are an important element in the evidence that lee harvey oswald fired the shot at general walker
as shown above the note and the photographs of walker's house and of the near by railroad tracks
provide important corroboration for her account of the incident
other details described by marina oswald coincide with facts developed independently of her statements
she testified that her husband had postponed his attempt to kill walker
until that wednesday because he had heard that there was to be a gathering at the church next door to walker's house on that evening
he indicated that he wanted more people in the vicinity at the time of the attempt so that his arrival and departure would not attract great attention
an official of this church told f b i agents that services are held every wednesday at the church except during the month of august
marina oswald also testified that her husband had used a bus to return home
a study of the bust routs indicates that
oswald could have taken any one of several different buses to walker's house or to a point near the railroad tracks where he may have concealed the rifle
it would have been possible for him to take different routes in approaching and leaving the scene of the shooting
based on
one the contents of the note which oswald left for his wife on april tenth nineteen sixty three
two
the photographs found among oswald's possessions
three the testimony of firearms identification experts and four the testimony of marina oswald
the commission has concluded that lee harvey oswald attempted to take the life of major general edwin a walker resigned u s army
on april tenth nineteen sixty three
the finding that lee harvey oswald attempted to murder a public figure in april nineteen sixty three
was considered of probitive value in this investigation although the commission's conclusion concerning the identity of the assassin

richard m nixon incident
another alleged threat by oswald against a public figure involved former vice president richard m nixon
in january nineteen sixty four marina oswald and her business manager james martin
told robert oswald we harvey oswald's brother that oswald had once threatened to shoot former vice president richard m nixon
when marina oswald testified before the commission on february three to six nineteen sixty four
she had failed to mention the incident when she was asked whether oswald had ever expressed any hostility
toward any official of the united states
the commission first learned of this incident when robert oswald related it to f bie agents on february nineteenth nineteen sixty four
and to the commission on february twenty one
marina oswald appeared before the commission again on june eleventh nineteen sixty four
and testified that a few days before her husband's departure from dawlis to new orleans on april twenty fourth nineteen sixty three
he finished reading a morning newspaper
quote and put on a good suit i saw that he took a pistol
i asked him where he was going and why he was getting dressed he answered nixon is coming
i want to go and have a look and quote
he also said that he would use the pistol if the opportunity arose
she reminded him that after the walker shooting he had promised never to repeat such an act
marina oswald related the events which followed quote
i called him into the bathroom and i closed the door
and i wanted to prevent him and then i started to cry
and i told him that he shouldn't do this and that he had promised me
i remember that i held him
we actually struggled for several minutes and then he quieted down and quote
she stated that it was not physical force which kept him from leaving the house wuell i couldn't keep him from going out if he really wanted to and quote
after further questioning
she stated that she might have been confused about shutting him in the bathroom but that quote there is no doubt that he got dressed and got a gun and quote
aswald's revolver
was shipped from los angeles on march twenty nineteen sixty three and he left for new orleans on april twenty fourth nineteen sixty three
no edition of either dallass newspaper during the period january one nineteen sixty three to may fifteenth nineteen sixty three
mentioned any proposed visit by mister nixon to dalis
mister nixon advised the commission that the only time he was in dawis in nineteen sixty three
was on november twenty to twenty one nineteen sixty three
an investigation failed to reveal any invitation extended to mister nixon during the period when oswald's threat reportedly occurred
the commission has concluded therefore that regardless of what oswald may have said to his wife
he was not actually planning to shoot mister nixon at that time endowlis
on april twenty three nineteen sixty three
vice president lindon b johnson was indowous for a visit which had been publicized in the dallast newspapers
throughout april
the commission asked marina oswald whether she might have misunderstood the object of her husband's threat she stated quote
there is no question
that in this incident
it was a question of mister nixon
and quote
when asked later whether it might have been mister johnson

she said
quote
yes
no
i am getting a little confused with so many questions
i was absolutely convinced it was nixon
and now after all these questions
i wonder if i'm right in my mind
and quote
she stated further that oswald had only mentioned nixon's name once during the incident

marina oswald might have misunderstood her husband
mister johnson was the ben vice president
and his visit took place on april twenty third

this was one day before oswald left for new orleans and marina appeared certain
that the nixon incident quote
wasn't the day before
perhaps three days before
and quote
marina oswald speculated
that the incident may have been unrelated to an actual threat
she said quote
it might have been that he was just trying to test me
he was the kind of person who could try and wound somebody in that way
possibly he didn't want to go out at all
but was just doing this all as a sort of joke
not really as a joke but rather to simply wound me to make me feel bad
and quote
in the absence of other evidence that oswald actually intended to shoot some one at this time
the commission concluded that the incident is described by marina oswald
was of no probitive value in the commission's decision concerning the identity of the assassin of president kennedy
oswald's rifle capability
in deciding whether lee harvey oswald fired the shots which killed president kennedy and wounded governor connolly
the commission considered whether oswald using his own rifle
possessed the capability to hit his target with two out of three shots under the conditions described in chapter three
the commission ivaluated one the nature of the shots
two oswald's marine training and marksmanship
three his experience and practice after leaving the marine corps
and four the accuracy of the weapon and the quality of the ammunition
the nature of the shots
for a riflemen situated on the sixth floor of the texas schoolbook depository building
the shots were at a slow moving target proceeding on a down grade in virtually a straight line
with the allignment of the assassin's rifle at a range of one hundred seventy seven to two hundred sixty six feet
an aerial photograph of dealy plaza shows that elm street runs at an angle
so that the president would have been moving in an almost straight line away from the assassin's rifle
in addition the three degree downward slope of elm street was of assistance in eliminating at least some of the adjustment
which is ordinarily required when a marksman must raise his rifle as a target moves farther away
for marksmanship experts testified before the commission
major eugene d anderson assistant head of the marksmanship branch of the u s marine corps
testified that the shots which struck the president in the neck and in the head were quote not particularly difficult and quote
robert a frazser f be i expert in fire arms identification and training said quote
from my own experience in shooting over the years
when you shoot at one hundred seventy five feet or two hundred sixty feet which is less than a hundred yards with a telescopic sight
you should not have any difficulty in hitting your target i mean it requires no training at all to shoot a weapon with a telescopic sight
once you know that you must put the cross hairs on the target and that is all that is necessary
ronald simmonds chief of the u s army infantry weapons of valuation branch of the belistic's research laboratory said quote
well in order to achieve three hits
it would not be required that a man be an exceptional shot
a proficient man with this weapon yes and quoh
the effect of a forepower telescopic sight on the difficulty of these shots was considered in detail
by master sergeant james a zam non commissioned officer in charge of the marksmanship training unit in the weapons training battalion
of the marine cors school at quantico virginia
referring to a rifle with a four power telescope sergeant zahm said quote
this is the ideal type of weapon for moving targets
using the scope rapidly working a bolt and using the scope to relocate your target quickly and at the same time when you locate that target
you identify it and the cross hairs are in close relationship to the point you want to shoot at
it just takes a minor move in aiming to bring the cross hairs to bear and then it is a quick squeeze
i consider it a real advantage particularly at the range of one hundred yards in identifying your target
it allows you to see your target clearly and it is still of a minimum amount of power that it doesn't exaggerate your own body movements
it just is an aid in seeing in the fact that you only have the one element the cross hair
in relation to the target as opposed to iron sites with lining the sights and then aligning them on the target and
characterizing before power scope as a quote real aid and extreme aid and quote in rapid fire shooting
sergeant zahm expressed the opinion that the shot which struck president kennedy in the neck at one hundred seventy six point nine
to one hundred ninety point eight feet was quote very easy and quote and the shot which struck the president in the head
at a distance of two hundred sixty five point three feet was quote an easy shot and quote
after viewing photographs depicting the allignment of elm street
in relation to the texas schoolbook depository building
zam stated further quote
this is a definite advantage to the shooter
the vehicle moving directly away from him ond the down grade of the street and he being in an elevated position
made an almost stationary target while he was aiming in
very little movement if any and quote
oswald's marine training
in accordance with standard marine procedures oswald received extensive training in marksmanship
during the first week of an intensive eight week training period he received instruction in citing aiming at manipulation of the trigger
he went through a series of exercises called dry firing where he assumed all positions which would later be used in the qualification course
after familiarization with live ammunition in the twenty two rifle and the twenty two pistol
oswald like all marine recruits received training on the rifle range at distances up to five hundred yards
firing fifty rounds each day for five days
following that training
oswald was tested in december of nineteen fifty six and obtained a score of two hundred twelve
which was two points above the minimum for qualifications as a sharpshooter in a scale of marksmen sharpshooter expert
in may of nineteen fifty nine on another range oswald scored one hundred ninety one which was one point over the minimum for ranking as a marksman
the marine corps records maintained on oswald further show that he had fired and was familiar with the browning automatic rifle
forty five calibre pistol and twelve gauge riot gun
based on the general marine courratings lieutenant colonel a g fulsam junior
head records branch personnel department headquarters u s marine corps
valuated the sharp shooter qualification as a quote fairly good shot and quot and a low marksman rating
as a quoth rather poor shot and quoat
when asked to explain the different scores achieved by oswald on the two occasions when he fired for record
major anderson said quote
when he fired that two twelve
he had just completed a very intensive preliminary training period
he had the services of an experienced highly trained coach
he had high motivation
he had presumably a good too excellent rifle and good ammunition
we have nothing here to show under what conditions the bee course was fired it might well have been a bad day for firing the rifle
windy rainy dark there is little probability that he had a good expert coach
and he probably didn't have as high a motivation because he was no longer in recruit training and under the care of the drill instructor
there is some possibility that the rifle he was firing might not have been as good
a rifle as the rifle that he was firing in his a horse firing
because he may well have carried this rifle for quite some time and had got banged around in normal usage
and quote
major anderson concluded quote
i would say that
as compared to other marines receiving the same type of training
that oswald was a good shot
somewhat better than or equal to better than the average
let us say
as compared to a civilian who had not received this intensive training he would be considered as a good too excellent shot and quote
when sergeant zohm was asked whether oswald's marine cort training would have made it easier to operate a rifle with a four power scope he replied quote
based on that training
his base acknowledge and sight manipulation and trigger squeeze and what not i would say that he would be capable of sighting that rifle in well
firing it with ten rounds
after reviewing oswald's marksmanship scores
sergeant zam concluded quote i would say in the marine corps he is a good shot slightly above average
and as compared to the average mal of his age throughout the civilian throughout the united states that he is an excellent shot
and quote
oswald's rifle practice outside the marines
during one of his leaves from the marines oswald hunted with his brother robert
using a twenty two calibre bolt action rifle belonging either to robert or robert's inlaws
after he left the marines and before departing for russia oswald his brother and a third companion
went hunting for squirrels and rabbits
on that occasion oswald again used a bolt action twenty too calibere rifle and according to robert
lee oswald exhibited an average amount of proficiency with that weapon
oswald obtained a hunting license joined a hunting club
and went hunting about six times as discussed more fully in chapter six
soon after oswald returned from the soviet union
he again went hunting with his brother robert and used a borrowed twenty two calibre bolt action rifle
after oswald purchased the manlooker carcano rifle he told his wife that he practised with it
marina oswald testified that on one occasion she saw him take the rifle concealed in a rain coat from the house on neelie street
oswald told her he was going to practise with it
according to george de marin schaltz
oswald said that he went target shooting with that rifle
marina oswald testified that in new orleans in may of nineteen sixty three
she observed oswald sitting with the rifle on their screened porch at night
sighting with the telescopic lens and operating the bolt
examination of the cartridge case is found on the sixth floor of the depository building
established that they had been previously loaded and ebjected from the assassination rifle
which would indicate that oswald practised operating the bolt
accuracy of weapon
it will be recalled from the discussion in chapter three
that the assassin in all probability hit two out of the three shots during the maximum time span of
four point eight to five point six seconds if the second shot missed
or if either the first or third shots missed the assassin fired the three shots during a minimum time span of seven point one
to seven point nine seconds
a series of tests were performed to determine whether the weapon and ammunition used in the assassination
were capable of firing the shots which were fired by the assassin on november twenty two nineteen sixty three
the ammunition used by the assassin was manufactured by western cartridge company of east alton illinois
in tests with the manlooker cork cano see twenty seven sixty six rifle over one hundred rounds of this ammunition were fired by the f be in
and the infantry weapons o valuation branch of the u s army there were no misfires
in an effort to test the rifle under conditions which simulated those which prevailed during the assassination
the infantry weapons valuation branch of the belistic's research laboratory had expert riflemen fire the assassination weapon
from a tower at three silhouette targets at distances of one hundred seventy five two hundred forty and two hundred sixty five feet
the target at two hundred sixty five feet was placed to the right of the two hundred forty foot target
which was in turn placed to the right of the closest silhouette
using the assassination rifle mounted with the telescopic sight
three marksmen
rated as master by the national rifle association
each fired two series of three shots
in the first series the firers required time spans of four point six six point seven five
and eight point two five seconds respectively
on the second series they required five point one five
six point four five and seven seconds
none of the marksmen had any practice with the assassination weapon except for exercising the bolt for two or three minutes on a dry run
they had not even pulled the trigger because of concern about breaking the firing pin
the marksmen took as much time as they wanted for the first target and all hit the target
for the first four attempts
the firers missed the second shot
by several inches
the angle from the first to the second shot
was greater
than from the second to the third shot
and required a movement in the basic firing position of the marksmen
this angle was used in the test because the majority of the eye witnesses to the assassination
stated that there was a shorter interval between shots two and three and between shots one and two
as has been shown in chapter three if the three shots were fired within a period of from four point eight to five point six seconds
the shots would have been evenly spaced and the assassin would not have incurred so sharp and angular movement
five of the six shots hit the third target where the angle of movement of the weapon was small
on the basis of these results simmons testified that in his opinion the probability of hitting the targets at the relatively short range at which they were hit
considering the various probabilities which may have prevailed during the actual assassination
the highest level of firing performance which would have been required of the assassin and the sea two seven six six rifle
would have been to fire three times and hit the target twice within a span of four point eight to five point six seconds
in fact one of the firers in the rapid fire test in firing his two series of three shots
hit the target twice within a span of four point six and five point one five seconds
the others would have been able to reduce their times if they had been given the opportunity to become familiar with the movement of the bolt and the trigger pole
simmons testified that familiarity with the bolt could be achieved in dry practice and as has been indicated above
oswald engaged in such practice if the assassin missed either the first or third shot
he had a total of between four point eight and five point six seconds between the two shots which hit
and a total minimum time period of from seven point one to seven point nine seconds for all three shots
all three of the firers in these tests
were able to fire the rounds within the time period
which would have been available to the assassin under those conditions
three f beind firearms experts tested the rifle in order to determine the speed with which it could be fired
the purpose of this experiment was not to test the rifle under conditions which prevailed at the time of the assassination
but to determine the maximum speed at which it could be fired
the three f beyond experts each fired three shots from the weapon at fifteen yards in six seven and nine seconds
and one of these agents robert a fraser
fired two series of three shots at twenty five yards in four point six and four point eight second
at fifteen yards each man's shots landed within the size of a dime
the shots fired by fraser at the range of twenty five yards landed within an area of two inches and five inches respectively
fraser later fired four groups of three shots at a distance of one hundred yards in five point nine
six point two
five point six and six point five seconds
each series of three shots landed within areas ranging in diameter from three to five inches
although all of the shots were a few inches high and to the right of the target
this was because of a defect in the scope which was recognized by the f beind agents and which they could have compensated for if they were aiming to hit a bull's eye
they were instead firing to determine how rapidly the weapon could be fired and the area within which three shots could be placed
fraser testified bat
while he could not tell when the defect occurred but that a person familiar with the weapon could compensate for it
moreover the defect was one which would have assisted the assassin aiming at a target which was moving away
fraser said quote
the fact that the cross hairs are set high would actually compensate for any lead which had to be taken
so that if you aimed with this weapon as it actually was received at the laboratory it would not be necessary to take any lead whatsoever
in order to hit the intended object the scope would accomplish the lead for you and quote
fraser added that the scope would cause a slight miss to the right
should be noted however that the president's car was curving slightly to the right when the third shot was fired
based on these tests the experts agreed that the assassination rifle was an accurate weapon
symmons described it as quote quite accurate and quote in fact as accurate as current military rifles
fraser testified that the rifle was accurate that it had less recoil than the average military rifle
and that one would not have to be an expert marksman to have accomplished the assassination with the weapon which was used
the various tests showed that the manliker cor cano was an accurate rifle and that the use of a four power scope
was a substantial aid to rapid accurate firing
oswald's marine training and marksmanship
his other rifle experience and his established familiarity with this particular weapon
show that he possessed ample capability to commit the assassination
based on the known facts of the assassination
the marine marksmanship experts major anderson and sergeant zahm concurred in the opinion that oswald had the capability to fire three shots
with two heads within four point eight and five point six seconds
concerning the shots which struck the president in the back of the neck
sergeant zahm testified quote
with the equipment he oswald had and with his ability i consider it a very easy shot and quote
having fired this shot
the assassin was then required to hit the tarket one more time within a space of from fourt point eight to five point six second
on the basis of oswald's training and the accuracy of the weapon as established by the tests
the commission concluded that oswald was capable of accomplishing this second hit even if there was an intervening shot which missed
the probability of hitting the president a second time
would have been markedly increased if in fact he had missed either the first or third shots
thereby leaving a time span of four point eight
to five point six seconds between the two shots which struck their mark
the commission agrees with the testimony of marine marksmanship expert zom
that it was an easy shot to hit some part of the president's body and that the range where the rifleman would be expected to hit
would include the president's head
on the basis of the evidence reviewed in this chapter
the commission has found that lee harvey oswald
one
owned and possessed the rifle used to kill president kennedy and wound governor connolly
two
brought this rifle into the depository building on the morning of the assassination
three
was present at the time of the assassination
at the window from which the shots were fired
killed dalis police officer j d tippet in an apparent attempt to escape
five resisted arrest by drawing a fully loaded pistol and attempting to shoot another police officer
six
lied to the police after his arrest concerning important substantive matters
seven attempted in april nineteen sixty three to kill major general edwin a walker
and eight
possessed the capability with a rifle which would have enabled him to commit the assassination
report of the president's commission on the assassination of president kennedy the warrn commission report by the president's commission on the assassination of president kennedy
chapter seven lee harvey oswald background and possible motives part one
the evidence reviewed above identifies lee harvey oswald as the assassin of president kennedy and indicates that he acted alone in that event
there is no evidence that he had accomplices or that he was involved in any conspiracy
directed to the assassination of the president
there remains the question of what impelled oswald to conceive and to carry out the assassination of the president of the united states
the commission has considered many possible motives for the assassination including those which might flow from oswald's commitment to marxism or communism
the existence of some personal grievance
a desire to effect changes in the structure of society or simply to go down in history as a well publicized assassin
none of these possibilities satisfactorily explains oswald's act if it is judged by the standards of reasonable men
the motives of any man however must be analyzed in terms of the character and state of mind of the particular individual involve
for a motive that appears incomprehensible to other men may be the moving force
of a man whose view of the world has been twisted
possibly by factors of which those round him were only dimly aware
oswald's complete state of mind and character are now outside of the power of man to know
he cannot of course be questioned or observed by those charged with responsibility for this report
or by experts on their behalf
there is however a large amount of material available in his writings
and in the history of his life which does give some insight into his character
and possibly into the motives for his act
since oswald is dead
the commission is not able to reach any definite conclusions as to whether or not he was quote sane unquote under prevailing legal standards
under our system of justice no forum could properly make that determination unless oswald were before it
it certainly could not be made by this commission which as has been pointed out above
ascertained the facts surrounding the assassination but did not draw conclusions concerning oswald's legal guilt
indications of oswald's motivation
may be obtained from a study of the events relationships and influences which appear to have been significant in shaping his character and in guiding him
perhaps the most outstanding conclusion of such a study is that oswald was profoundly alienated from the world in which he lived
his life was characterized by isolation frustration and failure
he had very few if any close relationships with other people and he appeared to have great difficulty in finding a meaningful place in the world
he was never satisfied with anything
when he was in the united states he resented the capitalist system which he thought was exploiting him and others like him
he seemed to prefer the soviet union and he spoke highly of cuba
when he was in the soviet union he apparently resented the communist party members
who were accorded special privileges and who he thought were betraying communism and he spoke well of the united states
he accused his wife of preferring others to himself and told her to return to the soviet union without him but without a divorce
at the same time he professed his love for her and said that he could not get along without her
marina oswald thought that he would not be happy anywhere quote only on the moon perhaps and quote
while oswald appeared to most of those who knew him as a meek and harmless person he sometimes imagined himself as quoth the commander and quote
and apparently seriously as a political prophet a man who said that after twenty years he would be prime minister
his wife testified that he compared himself with great readers of history
such ideas of grandeur were apparently accompanied by notions of oppression
he had a great hostility toward his environment whatever it happened to be
which he expressed in striking and sometimes violent acts long before the assassination
there was some quality about him that led him to act with an apparent disregard for possible consequences
he defected to the soviet union
shot at general walker
tryed to go to cuba
and even contemplated high jacking an aeroplane to get there
he assassinated the president
shot officer tippet
resisted arrest
and tried to kill another policeman in the process
oswald apparently started reading about communism when he was about fifteen
in the marines he evidenced a strong conviction
as to the correctness of mark's doctrine
which one associate described as
quote
irrevocable
and quote but also as quote theoretical and
that associate did not think that oswald was a communist
oswald did not always distinguish between marxism and communism
he stated several times that he was a communist but apparently never joined any communist party
his attachment to marksist and communist doctrine was probably in some measure an expression of his hostility to his environment
while there is doubt about how fully oswald understood the doctrine which he so often espoused it seems clear
that his commitment to marxism was an important factor
influencing his conduct during his adult years
it was an obvious element in his decision to go to russia and later to cuba and it probably influenced his decision to shoot a general walker
it was a factor which contributed to his character and thereby might have influenced his decision to assassinate president kennedy
the discussion below will describe the events known to the commission which most clearly reveals the formation and nature of oswald's character
it will attempt to summarize the events of his early life his experience in new york city and in the marine corps and his interest in marxism
it will examine his defection to the soviet union in nineteen fifty nine his subsequent return to the united states and his life here
after june of nineteen sixty two
the review of the latter period will evaluate his personal and employment relations his attempt to kill general walker his political activities
and his unsuccessful attempt to go to cuba in late september of nineteen sixty three
various possible motives will be treated in the appropriate context of the discussion
outlined above
the early years
significant in shaping the character of lee harvey oswald was the death of his father a collector of insurance premiums
this occurred two months before le was born in new orleans on october eighteenth nineteen thirty nine
that death strained the financial fortunes of the remainder of the oswald family
it had its effect on lee's mother marguerite his brother robert who had been born in nineteen thirty four
and his half brother john pick who had been born in nineteen thirty two during marguerite's previous marriage
it forced marguerite oswald to go to work to provide for her family
reminding her sons that they were orphans and that the family's financial condition was poor
she placed john pick and robert oswald in an orphan's home
from the time marguerite oswald returned to work until december twenty sixth nineteen forty two when lee too was sent to the orphans home
he was cared for principally by his mother's sister by baby sitters and by his mother when she had time for him
marguerite oswald withdrew leave from the orphan's home and took him with her to dalis when he was a little over four years old
about six months later she also withdrew john pick and robert oswald
apparently that action was taken in anticipation of her marriage to edwin a ecdol which took place in may of nineteen forty five
in the fall of that year john pick and robert oswald went to a military academy
where they stayed except for vacations until the spring of nineteen forty eight
lee oswald remained with his mother and ecdol to whom he became quite attached
john pick testified that he thoughtly found in exdole the father that he never had
that situation however was short lived
for the relations between marguerite oswald and ecdal were stormy and they were finally divorced after several separations and reunions
in the summer of nineteen forty eight
after the divorce missus oswald complained considerably about how unfairly she was treated
dwelling on the fact that she was a widow with three children
john pick however did not think her position was worse than that of many other people
in the fall of nineteen forty eight she told john pick and robert oswald
but she could not afford to send them back to the military school and she asked pick to quit school entirely to help support the family
which he did for four months in the fall of nineteen forty eight
in order to supplement their income further she falsely swore that pick was seventeen years old so that he could join the marine corps reserves
pick did turn over part of his income to his mother
but he returned to high school in january of nineteen forty nine where he stayed until three days before he was scheduled to graduate
when he left school in order to get into the coastguard
since his mother did not approve of his decision to continue school
he accepted the responsibility for that decision himself and signed his mother's name to all his own excuses and report cards
pick thought that his mother overstated her financial problems and was unduly concerned about money
referring to the period after the divorce from ecdole which was apparently caused in part by marguerite's desire to get more money from him
pick said quote
lee was brought up in this atmosphere of constant money problems and i'm sure it had quite an effect on him and also robert and quote
marguerite oswald worked in miscellaneous jobs after her divorce from ecdole
when she worked for a time as an insurance sales lady
she would sometimes take leave with her apparently leaving him alone in the car while she transacted her business
when she worked during the school year lee had to leave an empty house in the morning
returned to it for lunch and then again at night his mother having trained him to do that rather than to play with other children
an indication of the nature of lee's character at this time was provided in the spring of nineteen fifty
when he was sent to new orleans to visit the family of his mother's sister missus lilian murrett for two or three weeks
despite their urgings he refused to play with the other children his own age
it also appears that lee tried to tag along with his older brothers
but apparently was not able to spend as much time with them as he would have liked because of the age gaps of five and seven years
which became more significant as the children grew older
whatever problems may have been created by lee's home life in louisiana and texas
he apparently adjusted well enough there to have had an average although gradually deteriorating school record
with no behaviour or truantcee problems
that was not the case however after he and his mother moved to new york in august of nineteen fifty two shortly before lee's thirteenth birthday
they moved shortly after robert joined the marines they lived for a time with john pick who was stationed there with the coastguard
relations soon became strained however so in late september lee and his mother moved to their own apartment in the bronx
pick and his wife would have been happy to have kept lee however
who was becoming quite a disciplinary problem for his mother having struck her on at least one occasion
the short lived stay with the picks was terminated after an incident in which lee allegedly pulled out a pocket knife during an argument
and threatened to use it on missus parr
when pick returned home missus oswald tried to play down the event but missus pitt took a different view and asked the oswalds to leave
lee refused to discuss the matter with pick whom he had previously idolized and their relations were strained thereafter
on september thirtieth nineteen fifty two lay enrolled in p s one seventeenh
a junior high school in the bronx where the other children apparently teased him because of his quote western clothes and texas accent
he began to stay away from school preferring to read magazines and watch television at home by himself
this continued despite the efforts of the school authorities and to a lesser extent of his mother to have him return to school
truant see charges were brought against him alleging that he was quote beyond the control of his mother in so far as school attendants is concerned and quote
oswald was remanded for psychiatric observation to youth house an institution in which children are kept for psychiatric observation
or for detention pending court appearance or commitment to a child carrying or custodial institution such as a training school
he was in youth house from april sixteenth to may seventh nineteen fifty three
during which time he was examined by its chief sychietrist doctor renatis heartogs
and interviewed and observed by other members of the youth house staff
marguerite oswald visited her son at youth's house where she recalled that she waited in lyine cote
with porto ricans and negroes and everything and quote
she said that her pocket book was searched quote
because the children in this home were such criminals
doke fiends and had been in criminal offences
that anybody entering this home had to be searched in case the parents were bringing cigarettes or narcotics or anything and quote
she recalled that lee cried and said quoth mother i want to get out of here
there are children in here who have killed people and smoke i want to get out and quote
marguerite oswald said that she had not realized until then in what kind of place her son had been confined
on the other hand lee told his probation officer john caro that quote
while he liked youth house he missed the freedom of doing what he wanted
he enticated
that he did not miss his mother and quote
missus evelyn d seagull a social worker who interviewed both li and his mother while le was confined in youth house
reported that lee quote confided that the worst thing about youth house was the fact that he had to be with other boys all the time
was disturbed about disrobing in front of them taking showers with them et cetera and quote
contrary to reports that appeared after the assassination
the psychiatric examination did not indicate that lioswald was a potential assassin
potentially dangerous that quote his outlook on life had strongly parannoyed overtones and quote or that he should be institutionalized
doctor hartog's did find oswald to be a tense with drawn and evasive boy who intensely disliked talking about himself and his feelings
he noted that we liked to give the impression that he did not care for other people but preferred to keep to himself
so that he was not bothered and did not have to make the effort of communicating
oswald with drawn tendencies and solitary habits were thought to be the result of quote
intense anxiety shyness feelings of awkwardness and insecurity and quote
he was reported to have said quote i don't want a friend and i don't like to talk to people
and quote anne quote i dislike everybody n
he was also described as having a quote vivid fhantasy life
turning around the topics of omnipotence and power through which he tries to compensate for his present shortcomings and frustrations and quote
doctor hartog's summarized his report by stating
bote
this thirteen year old well built boy has superior mental resources and functions only slightly below his capacity level
in spite of chronic truancy from school which brought him into youth house
no finding of neurological impairment or sycotic mental changes could be made
lee has to be diagnosed as quote personality pattern disturbance with skitsoid features and passive aggressive tendencies and quote
lee has to be seen as an emotionally quite disturbed youngster
who suffers under the impact of really existing emotional isolation
and deprivation lack of affection absence of family life and rejection by a self involved and conflicted mother
doctor hartog's recommended that oswal would be placed on probation on condition that he seek help and guidance through a child guidance clinic
there he suggested lee should be treated by a male sachiatrist who could substitute for the lack of a father figure
he also recommended that missus oswald's seek quote psychotherapeutic guidance through contact with a family agency and quote
the possibility of commitment was to be considered only if the probation plan was not successful
lee's withdrawal was also noted by missus seagll who described him as a quote seriously detached with drawn youngster and quothe
she also noted that there was quote a rather pleasant appealing quality about this emotionally starved affectionless youngster
which grows as one speaks to him and quote
she thought that he had detached himself from the world around him because quote no one in it ever met any of his needs for love and quote
she observed that ticilee's mother worked all day he made his own meals and spent all his time alone
because he didn't make friends with the boys in the neighborhood she thought that he quote withdrew into a completely solitary and detached existence
where he did as he wanted and he didn't have to live by any rules or come into contact with people and quote
missus seagle concluded that lee quote just felt that his mother never gave a dam for him
he always felt like a burden that she simply just had to tolerate and quote
lee confirmed some of those observations by saying that he felt almost as if there were a veil between him and other people
through which they could not reach him but that he preferred the veil to remain intact
he admitted to fantasies about being powerful and sometimes hurting and killing people but refused to elaborate on them
he took the position that such matters were his own business
a psychological human figure drawing test corroborated the interviewer's findings that lee was insecure and had limited social contacts
irving sakela a youth house psychologist reported that quote
the human figure drawings are empty poor characterizations of persons approximately the same age as the subject
they reflect a considerable amount of impoverishment in the social and emotional areas
he appears to be a somewhat insecure youngster exhibiting much inclination for warm and satisfying relationships to others
there is some indication that he may relate to men more easily than to women in view of the more mature conceptualization
he appears slightly withdrawn and in view of the lack of detail within the drawings this may assume a more significant characteristic
he exhibits some difficulty in relationship to the maternal figure suggesting more anxiety in this area than in any other
lee scored and i que of one eighteen on the wexler intelligenc scale for children
according to sakelo this indicated a quote present intellectual functioning in the upper range of bright normal intelligence and quote
so kulau said that
although lee was quote presumably disinterested in school subjects he operates on a much higher than average level and quote
on the monroe silent breeding test lee's score indicated no retardation in reading speed and comprehension
he had better than average ability in arithmetical reasoning for his age group
lee told caro his probation officer that he liked to be by himself because he had too much difficulty in making friends
the reports of caro and missus seagl also indicate an ambivalent attitude toward authority on oswald's part
carol reported that lee was disruptive in class after he returned to school on a regular basis in the full of nineteen fifty three
he had refused to salute the flag and was doing very little if any were
it appears that he did not want to do any of the things which the authoriti suggested in their efforts to bring him out of the shell
into which he appeared to be retreating
he told missus seagll that he would run away if sent to a boarding school
on the other hand he also told her that he wished his mother had been more firm with him in her attempts to get him to return to school
the reports of the new york authorities indicate that lee's mother gave him very little affection and did not serve as any sort of substitute for a father
furthermore she did not appear to understand her own relationship to lease psychological problems
after her interview with missus oswald
missus seagl described her as a smartly dressed gray haired woman very self possessed and alert and superficially affable
but essentially a quote defensive rigid self involved person
who had real difficulty in accepting and relating to people and quote and who had quote little understanding and quote of lee's behavior
and of the quote protective shell he has drawn around himself and quote doctor hartogs reported that missus oswald did not understand
that lese withdrawal was a form of quote violent but silent protest against his neglect by her
and represents his reaction to a complete absence of any real family life and quote
carol reported
that when questioned about his mother lee said whot
well i've got to live with her i guess i love her and quoth
it may also be significant that as reported by john pick quote lee slept with my mother until i joined the service in nineteen fifty
this would make him approximately ten well almost eleven years old
and quoth
the factors in lee oswald's personality which were noted by those who had contact with him in new york indicate
that he had great difficulty in adapting himself to conditions in that city
his usual reaction to the problems which he encountered there was simply withdrawal
those factors indicated a severe inability to enter into relationships with other people
in view of his experiences when he visited his relatives in new orleans in the spring of nineteen fifty and his other solitary habits
lee had apparently been experiencing similar problems before going to new york
and as will be shown below this failure to adapt to his environment was a dominant trait in his later life
it would be incorrect however to believe that those aspects of lee's personality which were observed in new york
could have led any one to predict the outburst of violence which finally occurred
caro was the only one of oswald's three principal observers who recommended that he be placed in a boy's home or similar institution
but carol was quite specific that his recommendation was based primarily on the adverse factors in lee's environment
his lack of friends the apparent unavailability of any agency assistance and the ineffectualness of his mother
and not on any particular mental disturbance in the boy himself
caro testified that quote there was nothing that would lead me to believe when i saw him at the age of twelve
that there would be seeds of destruction for somebody
i couldn't in all honesty sincerely say such a thing
missus siagle concluded her report with the statement that quote
despite his withdrawal he gives the impression that he is not so difficult to reach as he appears and patient prolonged effort
in a sustained relationship with one therapist might bring results
there are indications that he has suffered serious personality damage but if he can receive help quickly this might be repaired to some extent and quote
we oswald never received that help
few social agencies even in new york were equipped to provide the kind of intensive treatment that he needed
and when one of the citie's clinics did find room to handle him
for some reason the record does not show advantage was never taken of the chance afforded to oswald
when le became a disciplinary problem upon his return to school in the fall of nineteen fifty three
and when his mother failed to co operate in any way with school authorities
authorities were finally forced to consider placement in a home for boys
such a placement was postponed however perhaps in part at least because leese behaviour suddenly improved
before the court took any action the oswalds left new york in january of nineteen fifty four
and returned to new orleans where le finished the ninth grade before he left school to work for a year

chapter seven lee harvey oswald
background and possible motives part two
returned to new orleans and joining the marine core
after his return to new orleans oswald was teased at school because of the northern accent which he had acquired
he concluded that school had nothing to offer him
his mother exercised little control over him and thought he could decide for himself whether to go on in school
neighbors and others who knew him at that time recall an introverted boy who read a great deal
he took walks and visited museums and sometimes rode a rented bicycle in the park on saturday mornings
missus murrit believes that he talked at length with the girl on the telephone but no one remembers that he had any dates
a friend edward vobol
testified that quote
he was more bashful about girls than anything else and quote
several witnesses testified that lei oswald was not aggressive he was however involved in some fights
once a group of white boys beat him up for sitting in the negro section of a bus which he apparently did simply out of ignorance
another time he fought with two brothers who claimed that he had picked on the younger of them three years oswald's junior
two days later quote some big guy probably from a high school he looked like a tremendous football player and quote
accosted oswald on the way home from school and punched him in the mouth making his lip bleed and loosening a tooth
bobol took oswald back to the school to attend to his wounds and their qoat mild friendship and quote stemmed from that incident
vobel also recalled that oswald once outlined a plan to cut the glass in the window of a store on rampart street and steal a pistol
but he was not sure then that oswald meant to carry out the plan and in fact they never did
bobul said that oswald quote wouldn't start any fights but if you wanted to start one with him he was going to make sure that he ended it
or you are going to really have one because he wasn't going to take anything from anybody
and quote
in a space for the names of quote close friends and quote on the ninth grade personal history record
oswald first wrote quote edward vogal qut an obvious misspelling of vobl's name
and quote arthor a bear and quote most likely arthur a bear a classmate who has said that he did not know us wald well
oswald eraced those names however and indicated that he had no close friends
it has been suggested that this misspelling of names apparently on a phonetic basis was caused by a reading spelling disability
from which oswald appeared to suffer
other evidence of the existence of such a disability is provided by the many other misspellings that appear in oswald's writings portions of which are quoted below
sometime during this period and under circumstances to be discussed more fully below
oswald started to read communist literature which he obtained from the public library
one of his fellow employees palmer mac bride
stated that oswald said he would like to kill president isenhower
because he was exploiting the working class
oswald praised cruschef and suggested that he and mac bride joined the communist party quote to take advantage of their social functions and quote
oswald also became interested in the new orleans amateur astronomy association an organization of high school students
the associations then president willm e wolf testified that he remembered an occasion when oswald quote
started expounding the communist doctrine and saying that he was highly interested in communism that communism was the only way of life for the worker et cetera
and then came out with a statement that he was looking for a communist' cell in town to join but he couldn't find any
he was a little dismayed at this and he said that he couldn't find any that would show any interest in him as a communist
and subsequently after this conversation my father came in and we were kind of arguing back and forth about the situation and my father came in the room
heard what we were arguing on communism and that this boy was loud mouthed boisterous and my father asked him to leave the house and politely put him out of the house
and that is the last i have seen or spoken with oswald and quote
despite this apparent interest in communism
oswald tried to join the marines when he was sixteen years old
this was one year before his actual enlistment and just a little over two point five years after he left new york
he wrote a note in his mother's name to school authorities in new orleans saying that he was leaving school because he and his mother were moving to san diego
in fact he had quit school in an attempt to obtain his mother's assistance to join the marines
while he apparently was able to induce his mother to make a false statement about his age
he was nevertheless unable to convince the proper authorities that he was really seventeen years old
there is evidence that oswald was greatly influenced in his decision to join the marines by the fact that his brother robert had done so
approximately three years before robert oswald had given his marine corp manual to his brother lee
who studied it during the year following his unsuccessful attempt
to enlist until quote
he knew it by heart and quote
according to marguerite oswald quote le lived for the time that he would become seventeen years old to join the marines that whole year and quote
in john pick's view
oswald was motivated to join the marines in large part by a desire quote
to get from out and under the yoke of oppression from my mother and quote
oswald's inability or lack of desire to enter into meaningful relationships with other people
continued during this period in new orleans nineteen fifty four to nineteen fifty six
it probably contributed greatly to the general dissatisfaction which he exhibited with his environment
a dissatisfaction which seemed to find expression at this particular point
in his intense desire to join the marines and get away from his surroundings and his mother
his study of communist literature
which might appear to be inconsistent with his desire to join the marines could have been another manifestation of oswald's rejection of his environment
his difficulty in relating to other people and his general dissatisfaction with the world around him continued while he was in the marine corp
carry thornly a marine associate
who shortly after oswald's defection wrote an as yet unpublished novel based in considerable part on oswald's life
testified that quote definitely the marine corps was not what he had expected it to be when he joined and quote
he said that oswald quote seemed to guard against developing real close friendships and quote
daniel powers another marine who was stationed with oswald for part of his marine career
testified
that oswald seemed quote always to be striving for a relationship but whenever he did
his general personality would alienate the group against him and quote
other marines also testified that oswald had few friends and kept very much to himself
while there is nothing in oswald's military records to indicate that he was mentally unstable or otherwise psychologically unfit for duty in the marine corps
he did not adjust well to conditions which he found in that service
he did not rise above the rank of private first class even though he had passed a qualifying examination for the rank of corporal
his marine career was not helped by his attitude
that he was a man of great ability and intelligence and that many of his superiors in the marine corps were not sufficiently competent to give him orders
while oswald did not seem to object to authority in the abstract he did think that he should be the one to exercise it
john e donovan one of his former officers testified that oswald thought quote
that authority particularly the marine corps ought to be able to recognize talent such as his own without a given magic college degree
and put them in positions of prominence and quote oswald manifested this feeling about authority by baiting his officers
he led them into discussions of foreign affairs about which they often knew less than he did since he had apparently devoted considerable time to a study of such matters
when the officers were unable to discuss foreign affairs satisfactorily with him oswald regarded them as unfit to exercise command over him
nelson del gado one of oswald's fellow marines testified that oswald tried to quote cut up anybody that was high ranking and quote
in those arguments quote and make himself come out top dog and quote
oswald probably engaged his superiors and arguments on a subject that he had studied
in an attempt to attract attention to himself and to support his exaggerated idea of his own abilities
thornly all so testified that he thought that oswald's extreme personal sloppiness in the marine corps quote
fitted into a general personality pattern of his to do whatever was not wanted of him a recalcitrant trend in his personality and quote
oswald quote seemed to be a person who would go out of his way to get into trouble and quote
and ben used the quote special treatment and quote he received as an example of the way in which he was being picked on and quote
as a means of getting or attempting to get sympathy and quote in thornly's view oswald labored under a persecution complex
which he strove to maintain and quote felt the marine core kept a pretty close watch on him because of his subversive activities and quote
thornly added quote
i think it was kind of necessary to him to believe that he was being picked on
it wasn't anything extreme
i wouldn't go as far as to call it
call him a paranoid
but a definite tendency there was in that direction i think
and quote
powers considered oswald to be meek and easily led
and quote individual that you would brain wash and quite easy but i think once he believed in something he stood in his beliefs and quote
powers also testified
that oswald was reserved
and seemed to be quote
somewhat the frail little puppy in the litter
and quote
he had the nickname
quote osi rabbit
and quoth
oswald read a good deal said powers but quoth he would never be reading any of the shoot em up westerns or anything like that
normally it would be a good type of literature
and the one that i recall was leaves of grass by walt whitman
and quoth
according to powers oswald said quote
all the marine cord did was to teach you to kill
and after you got out of the marines you might be good gangsters and quote
powers believed
that when oswald arrived in japan
he acquired a girl friend
quode
finally attaining a male status or image in his own eyes and quote

that apparently caused oswald to become more self confident
aggressive
and even somewhat pugnacious
although power's quote
wouldn't say that this ky is a trouble maker and quote
powers said quote now he was oswald the man rather than oswald the rabbit andqute
oswald once told powers that he didn't care if he returned to the united states at all
while in japan
oswald's new found apparent self confidence and pugnaciousness
led to an incident in which he spilled a drink on one of his sergeants
and abusively challenged him to fight
at the court martial hearing which followed
oswald admitted
that he had been rather drunk when the incident occurred
he testified that
he had felt the sergeant had a grudge against him
and that he had unsuccessfully sought a transfer from the sergeant's unit

he said that he had simply wanted to discuss the question with the sergeant
and the drink had been spilled accidentally
the hearing officer agreed with the latter claim
but found oswald guilty
of wrongfully using provoking words
and sentenced him twenty eight days
canceling the suspension
of a twenty day sentence that oswald had received in an earlier court martial
for possessing an unauthorized pistol with which he had accidentally shot himself
at his own request
oswald was transferred from active duty
to the marine corps reserve
under honorable conditions in september of nineteen fifty nine
three months prior to his regularly scheduled separation date ostensibly to care for his mother who had been injured in an accident at her work
he was undesirably discharged from the marine corps reserve to which he had been assigned on inactive status following his transfer from active duty
after it was learned
that he had defected to the soviet union
in an attempt to have this discharge reversed
oswald wrote to then secretary of the navy connolly
on january thirtith nineteen sixty two
stating that he would quote
employ all means to write this gross mistake or injustice and quote
governor connolly had just resigned to run for governor of texas so he advised oswald
that he had forwarded the letter to his successor
it is thus clear
that oswald knew that governor connolly was never directly concerned with his discharge
and he must have known that president kennedy had had nothing to do with it
in that connection
it does not appear that oswald ever expressed any dissatisfaction of any kind
with either the president
or governor connolly
marina oswald testified that she quote had never heard anything bad about kennedy from lee and he never had anything against him and quote
missus oswald said
that her husband did not say anything about governor connolly after his return to the united states
she testified quote
but while we were in russia he spoke well of him
leise said that when he would return to the united states

he would vote for him for governor
and quote
oswald must have already learned that the governor could not help him with his discharge
because he was no longer secretary of the navy
at the time he made that remark
even though oswald apparently did not express any hostility against the president or governor connolly
he continued to be concerned about his undesirable discharge it is clear that he thought he had been unjustly treated
probably his complaint was due to the fact that his discharge was not related
to anything he had done while on active duty
and also because he had not received any notice of the original discharge proceedings since his whereabouts were not known
he continued his efforts to reverse the discharge by petitioning the navy discharged review board
which finally declined to modify the discharge and so advised him in a letter dated july nineteen sixty three
governor connolly's connection with the discharge although indirect
caused the commission to consider whether he might have been oswald's real target
in that connection
it should be noted that marina oswald testified on september sixth nineteen sixty four that she thought her husband quote
was shooting it connolly rather than president kennedy and quote
in support of her conclusion
missus oswald noted her husband's undesirable discharge
and that she could not think of any reason why oswald would want to kill president kennedy
it should be noted however that at the time oswald fired the shots at the presidential limousine
the governor occupied the seat in front of the president
and it would have been almost impossible for oswald to have hit the governor
without hitting the president first
oswald could have shot the governor as the car approached the depository
or as it was making the turn on to elm street
once it had started down elm street toward the triple underpass however
the president almost completely blocked oswald's view of the governor
prior to the time the first shot struck the president
oswald would have had other and more favorable opportunities to strike at the governor than on this occasion when as a member of the president's party
he had more protection than usual
it would appear therefore that to the extent oswald's undesirable discharge affected his motivation
it was more in terms of a general hostility against the government and its representatives rather than a grudge against any particular person
interest in marxism
as indicated above
oswald started to read communist literature
after he and his mother left new york and moved to new orleans
he told a lean mosby
a reporter who interviewed him after he arrived in moscow quote
i'm a markist i became interested about the age of fifteen
from an ideological viewpoint
an old lady handed me a pamphlet about saving the rosenbergs i looked at that paper and i still remember it for some reason i don't know why and quoth
oswald studied marxism after he joined the marines and his sympathies in that direction and for the soviet union appear to have been widely known
at least in the unit to which he was assigned after his return from the far east
his interest in russia led some of his associates to call him comrade
here
as wald scobigch
he always wanted to play the red pieces and chests because
as he said in an apparently humorous context
he preferred the quit red army and quote
he studied the russian language
read a russian language newspaper
and seemed interested in what was going on in the soviet union
thornly
who thought oswald had an irrevocable conviction that his marks's beliefs were correct testified quote
i think you could sit down and argue with him for a number of years and i don't think you could have changed his mind on that unless you knew why he believed it in the first place
i certainly don't
i don't think with any kind of formal argument
you could have shaken that conviction and that is why i say irrevocable
it was just
never getting back to looking at things from any other way once he had become a markist whenever that was and quote
foreignly also testified about an incident which grew
out of a combination of oswald's known marks his sympathies and george orwell's book nineteen eighty four one of oswald's favourite books
which thornly read at oswald's suggestion
shortly after thornly finished reading that book
the marine unit
to which both men were assigned was required
to take part in a saturday morning parade
in honor of some retiring non commissioned officers an event which they both approached with little enthusiasm
while waiting for the parade to start
they talked briefly about nineteen eighty four
even though oswald seemed to be lost in his own thoughts after a brief period of silence oswald remarked on the stupidity of the parade
and on how angry it made him
to which thornly replied quote
well comes the revolution you will change all that and quote
thornly testified quote
at which time he looked at me like a betrayed caesar
and screamed screamed definitely
not you too thornly
and i remember his voice cracked as he said this
he was definitely disturbed at what i had said and i didn't really think i had said that much
i never said anything to him again
and he never said anything to me again
and quoth
thornly said that he had made his remark only in the context of nineteen eighty four
and had not intended any criticism of oswald's political views which is the way in which thornly thought oswald took his remarks
lieutenant donovan testified that oswald thought that quote there were many grave injustices concerning the affairs in the international situation and quote
he recalled
that oswald had a specific interest in latin america
particularly
cuba
and expressed opposition to the betista regime
and sympathy for castro
an attitude which donovan said was quote
not unpopular and quote at that time
donovan testified
that he never heard oswald express a desire personally to take part in the elimination of injustices anywhere in the world and that he quote
never heard him in any way shape or form confess that he was a communist
or that he ever thought about being a communist
and quote
delgatto testified
that oswald was quote
a complete believer
that our way of government was not quite right
and quote
and believed that our government
did not have quote too much to offer and quote
but was not in favor of quote
the communist way of life and quote
dogado and oswald talked more about cuba than russia
and sometimes imagined themselves as leaders in the cuban army or government
who might quote lead an expedition to some of these other islands and free them too and quote
thornly also believed that oswald's marks his beliefs led to an extraordinary view of history under which quote he looked upon the eyes of future people
as some kind of tribunal
and he wanted to be on the winning side so that ten thousand years from now
people would look in the history books and say well
this man was ahead of his time
the eyes of the future became
the eyes of god
he was concerned with his image in history and i do think that is why he chose
the particular method of defecting
he chose
and did it in the way he did
it got him in the newspapers it did broadcast his name out
and quoth
thoreignly thought that oswald not only wanted a place in history
but also wanted to live comfortably in the present
he testified that
if oswald could not have that qut degree of physical comfort that he expected or sought
i think he would then throw himself entirely on the other thing he also wanted which was the image in history
i think he wanted both if he could have them
if he didn't he wanted to die with the knowledge that
or with the idea that he was somebody
and quoth
oswald's interest in marxism led some people to avoid him
even though as his wife suggested
that interest may have been motivated by a desire to gain attention
he used his marksist at associated activities
as excuses for his difficulties in getting along in the world
which were usually caused by entirely different factors
his use of those excuses to present himself to the world as a person who was being unfairly treated
is shown most clearly by his employment relations after his return from the soviet union
of course
he made his real problems worse to the extent
that his use of those excuses
prevented him from discovering the real reasons for
and attempting to overcome his difficulties
of greater importance
oswald commitment to marxism contributed to the decisions
which led him to defect to the soviet union
in nineteen fifty nine
and later
to engage in activities on behalf of the fair play for cuba committee
in the summer of nineteen sixty three
report of the president's commission on the assassination of president kennedy
the warren commission report by the president's commission on the assassination of president kennedy chapter seven lee harvey oswald
background and possible motives part three
defection to the soviet union
after oswald left the marine corps in september of nineteen fifty nine ostensibly to care for his mother
he almost immediately left for the soviet union where he attempted to renounce his citizenship
at the age of nineteen oswald thus committed an act which was the most striking indication he had yet given
of his willingness to act on his beliefs in quite extraordinary ways
while his defection resulted in part from oswald's commitment to markism
it appears that personal and psychological factors were also involved
on august seventeenth nineteen sixty three oswald told mister william stuckey
who had arranged a radio debate on oswald's activities on behalf of the fair play for cuba committee
that while he had begun to read marks and angles at the age of fifteen the conclusive thing that made him decide that markism was the answer
was his service in japan
he said living conditions over there convinced him something was wrong with the system and that possibly marxism was the answer
he said it was in japan that he made up his mind to go to russia
and see for himself how a revolutionary society operates a marksis society
on the other hand at least one person who knew oswald after his return thought that his defection had a more personal and psychological basis
the validity of the latter observation is borne out by some of the things oswald wrote in connection with his defection
indicating that his motivation was at least in part a personal one on november twenty sixth nineteen fifty nine
shortly after he arrived in the soviet union and probably before soviet authorities had given him permission to stay indefinitely
he wrote to his brother robert that the soviet union was a country which quote i have always considered to be my own and quote
and that he went there quote only to find freedom i could never have been personally happy in the u s and quote
he wrote in another letter that he would quote never return to the united states which is a country i hate and quote
his idea that he was to find qoke freedom and quote in the soviet union was to be rudely shattered
whatever oswald's reasons for going to the soviet union might have been however there can be little doubt that his desire to go was quite strong
in addition to studying the russian language while he was in the marines
oswald had managed to save enough money to cover the expenses of his forthcoming trip
while there is no proof that he saved fifteen hundred dollars as he claimed
it would have taken considerable discipline to save whatever amount was required to finance his defection out of the salary of a low ranking enlisted man
the extent of oswald's desire to go to the soviet union
and of his initial commitment to that country can best be understood however in the context
of his concomitant hatred of the united states which was most clearly expressed in his november twenty sixth
and communists would like to see the present capitalist government of the u s overthrown and quote oswald stated
that that government supported an economic system quote which exploits all its workers and quote
and under which quote art culture and the spirit of man are subjected to commercial enterprising
and religion and education are used as a tool to suppress what would otherwise be a population questioning their governments unfair
economic system and plans for war and quote
he complained in his letter about segregation
on employment autimation
and the use of military forces to suppress other populations
asking his brother why he supported the american government and what ideals he put forward oswald wrote quote
ask me and i will tell you i fight for communism
i will not say your grandchildren will live under communism look for yourself at history look at a world map america is a dicing country
i do not wish to be a part of it nor do i ever again wish to be used as a tool in its military aggressions
this should answer your question and also give you a glimpse of my way of thinking so you speak of advantages do you think that is why i am here
for personal material advantages happiness is not based on one' self it does not consist of a small home of taking and getting
happiness is taking part in the struggle where there is no border line between one's own personal world and the world in general
i never believed i would find more material advantages at this stage of development in the soviet union
than i might have had in the u s
i have been a procomunist for years
and yet i have never met a communist
instead
i kept silent and observed
and what i observed plus my marksest learning
brought me here to the soviet union
i have always considered this country
to be my own
and quote
responding to robert's statement
that he had not renounced him
oswald told his brother
quone
on what terms i want this arrangement and quote he advised robert that
one
in the event of war
i would kill any american who put a uniform on
in defence of the american government
any american
two
um
that in my own mind
i have no attachments of any kind in the u s
three
that i want to
and i shall
live a normal happy and peaceful life here in the soviet union for the rest of my life
that my mother and you are in spite of what the newspapers said
not objects of affection
but only examples of workers in the u s
despite this commitment to the soviet union
oswald met disappointments there just as he had in the past at the outset
the soviets told him that he could not remain
it seems that oswald immediately attempted suicide
a striking indication of how much he desired
to remain in the soviet union
it shows how willing he was to act dramatically and decisively when he faced an emotional crisis
with few readily available alternatives at hand

he was shocked to find that the soviet union did not accept him with open arms
the entry in his self styled quote historic diary and quothe
for october twenty ounth nineteen fifty nine
reports quote
i am shocked
my dreams
i have waited for two years to be accepted
my fondest dreams are shattered because of a petty official i decide to end it
soak fist in cold water to numb the pain
then slash my left wrist
then plunge wrist into bath tub of hot water
somewhere a violin plays as i watch my life whirl away
i think to myself
how easy to die and a sweet death to violins
and quoth
oswald was discovered in time to thwart his attempt at suicide
he was taken to a hospital in moscow where he was kept until october twenty eighth
nineteen fifty nine
still intent however on staying in the soviet union
oswald went on october thirty one
to the american embassy to renounce his uuos citizenship
mister richard e snyder than second secretary and senior consul or official at the embassy
testified that
oswald was extremely sure of himself and seemed quote
to know what his mission was
he took charge in a sense of the conversation right from the beginning
and quote he presented the following signed note
quote
i ly harvey oswald do hereby request that my present citizenship in the united states of america
be revoked
i have entered the soviet union for the express purpose of applying for citizenship in a soviet union through the means of naturalization
my request for citizenship is now pending before the supreme soviet of the u s s r
i take these steps for political reasons
my request for the revoking of my american citizenship
is made only after the longest and most serious considerations i affirm that my allegiance is to the union of soviets socialist republics
and quote
as his quote principal reason and quote for renouncing his citizenship
oswald stated quote i am a marxist and quote he also alluded to hardships endured by his mother as a worker
referring to them as experiences that he did not intend to have himself even though he stated that he had never held a civilian job
he said that his marine service in okanawa and elsewhere had given him quote a chance to observe american imperialism and quote
but he also displayed some sensitivity
at not having reached a higher rank in the marine corps
he stated that he had volunteered
to give soviet officials any information that he had concerning marine corps operations and intimated
that he might know something of special interest oswald's historic diary
describes the event in part as follows quote
i leave embassy elated at this showdown
returning to my hotel
i feel now my energies are not spent in vain
i'm sure russians will accept me after this sign of my faith in them
and quote
soviet authorities finally permitted oswald to remain in their country
no evidence has been found that they used him for any particular propaganda or other political or informational purposes
they sent him to minsk
to work in a radio and television factory as a metal worker
the soviet authorities denied oswald permission
to attend a university in moscow
but they gave him a monthly allowance of seven hundred roubles a month
old exchange rate
in addition to his factory salary
of approximately equal amount
and considerably better living quarters than those accorded to soviet citizens of equal age and station
the subsidy
apparently similar to those sometimes given to foreigners allowed to remain in the soviet union
together with his salary
gave oswald an income which he said approximated that of the director of the factory in which he worked
even though he received more money and better living quarters than other russians doing similar work
he envied his wife's uncle
a colonel in the emv d
because of the larger apartment in which he lived
reminiscent of his attitude toward his superiors in the marine corps
oswald apparently resented the exercise of authority over him
and the better treatment afforded to communist party officials
after he returned to the united states
he took the position that the communest party officials in the soviet union were opportunists who were betraying their positions for personal gain
he is reported to have expressed the conclusion that they had
qu
fat stinking politicians over there just like we have over here and quote
oswald apparently continued to have personal difficulties while he was in misk
although marina oswald told the commission that her husband had good personal relationships in the soviet union catherine ford
one of the members of the russian community endowlis with which the oswalds became acquainted upon their arrival in the united states
stated that missus oswald told her
everybody in russia quote hated him
and quoth
jean de marenschalt another member of that group
said that oswald told her that he had returned because quote i didn't find what i was looking for and quote
george de maren shilt thought that oswald must have become disgusted with life in the soviet union as the novelty
of the presence of an american war off and he began to be less the centre of attention
the best description of oswald's state of mind however is set forth in his own historic diary
under the entry from may oneh nineteen sixty
he noted that one of his acquaintances quote
relates many things i do not know about the u s s are
i begin to feel uneasy inside it's true and quote
under the entry for august to september of that year he wrote quote
as my russian improves i become increasingly conscious of just what sort of a society i live in
mas gymnastics compulsory after work meeting
usually political information meeting
compulsory attendance at lectures and the sending of the entire shop collective except me to pick potatoes on a sunday at a state collective farm
a patriotic duty to bring in the harvest
the opinions of the workers unvoiced
ar that it's a great pain in the neck
they don't seem to be especially enthusiastic about any of the collective duties a natural feeling
i am increasingly aware of the presence in all thing
of labizen
shop party secretary
said
fortyish and jovial on the outside
he is in no nonsense party regular
finally
the entry of january four to thirty one of nineteen sixty one quote
i am starting to reconsider my desire about staying
the work is drabbed the money i get
has nowhere to be spent
no night clubs or bowling alleys
no places of recreation
except the trade union dances
i have had enus
shortly thereafter
less than eighteen months after his defection
about six weeks before he met
marina prusakova
oshold open negotiations with the u s embassy in moscow
looking toward his return to the united states
returne to the united states
in view of the intensity of his earlier commitment to the soviet union
a great change must have occurred in oswald's thinking to induce him to return to the united states
the psychological effects of that change
must have been highly unsettling
it should be remembered
but he was not yet twenty years old when he went to the soviet union
with such high hopes
and not quite twenty three when he returned
bitterly disappointed
his attempt to renounce his citizenship
had been an open expression of hostility against the united states
and a profound rejection of his early life
the dramatic brak with society in america now had to be undone
his return to the united states
publicly testified to the utter failure of what had been the most important act of his life
marina oswald confirmed the fact
that her husband was experiencing psychological difficulties at the time of his return
she said that quote immediately after coming to the united states le changed
i did not know him as such a man in russia
and quote
she added that while he helped her as he had done before he became more of a recluse that quote
he was very irritable
sometimes for a trifle
and quote and that quotly was very unrestrained and very explosive and quote
during the period from november nineteenth nineteen sixty two to march of nineteen sixty three
after the assassination she wrote
that quoth
in general our family life began to deteriorate after we arrived in america
we was always hot tempered
and now this trait of character more and more prevented us from living together in harmony
lee became very irritable
and sometimes
some completely trivial thing would drive him into a rage
i myself do not have a particularly quiet disposition
but i had to change my character a great deal in order to maintain
a more or less peaceful family life
and quoth
marina oswald's judgment of her husband's state of mind
may be substantiated by comparing material which he wrote in the soviet union
with what he wrote
while on the way back to the united states and after his return
while in the soviet union
he wrote his longest and clearest piece of work
the collective
this was a fairly coherent description of life in that country
basically centred around the radio and television factory in which he worked

while it was apparently intended for publication in the united states and is in many respects critical
of certain aspects of life in the soviet union
it appears to be the work of a fairly well organized person
oswald prefaced his manuscript with a short autobiographical sketch
which reads in part as follows quote

the harvey oswald was born in october nineteen thirty nine in new orleans louisiana
the sum of an insurant salesman
whose early death
left a far mean streak of independence brought on by neglect
entering the u s marine core at seventeen
this streak of independence was strengthened by exotic journeys to japan
the philippines
and the scores of odd islands in the pacific
immediately after serving out his three years in the u s marine corps
he abandoned his american life to seek a new life
in the u s s ar
full of optimism and hope
he stood in red square in the full of nineteen fifty nine
vowing to see his chosen course through
after however two years and a lot of growing up
i decided to return to the u s a
the collective
contrasts sharply with material which oswald seems to have written after he left the soviet union
which appears to be more an expression of his own psychological condition
than of a reasoned analysis
the latter material expresses great hostility to both communism
and capitalism
he wrote
that to a person knowing both of those systems quote
there can be no mediation between those systems as they exist to day
and that person
he must be opposed to their basic foundations and representatives and quote
and yet
it is immature to take the sort of attitude which says quote a curse on both your houses
and quoth

there are two great representatives of power in the world
simply expressed the left and right and their offspring factions and concerns
any practical attempt at one alternative
must have as its nucleus
the traditional ideological best of both systems
and yet be utterly opposed to both systems
such an alternative
was to be opposed both to capitalism and communism because quoth
no man having known having lived under the russian communist and american capitalist system
could possibly make a choice between them
there is no choice
one offers oppression
the other poverty
both offer imperialistic injustice
tinted with two brands of slavery
andth
oswald actually did attempt to formulate such an alternative
which he planned to quote put forward and quote himself
he thought the new alternative would have its best chance to be accepted after quote
conflict between the two world systems leaves the world country
without defence
or foundation of government and quote
after which the survivors would quote
sik
an alternative opposed to those systems
which have brought them misery and quoth
oswald realized that
quote their thinking and education will be steeped in the traditions of those systems
and they would never accept a new order complete beyond their understanding
and quoth
as a result he thought it would be quote
necessary
to oppose the old systems
but at the same time support their cherished traditions and quote
spanding on his ideas on how his alternative to communism and capitalism might be introduced he wrote of a quot readily foreseaable
economic political or military crisis
internal or external
which will bring about the final destruction of the capitalist system
and indicated that
preparation in a special party
could safeguard an independent course of action after the debacle
and quote
which would achieve the goal which was quothe
the emplacement of a separate
democratic
pure communist society
but one with union communes
democratic socializing of production
and without regard to the twisting apart
of markism marksist communism by other powers
wile quoth
resourcefulness and patient working towards the aforesaid goals
are preferred rather than loud and useless manifestations of protest and quote oswald went on to note quote
but these preferred tactics now
may prove to be too limited in the near future
they should not be confused with slowness indecision or fear
only the intellectually fearless could even be remotely attracted to our doctrine
and yet
this doctrine requires the utmost utmost restraint
a state of being in itself majestic in power and quote
oswald's decided rejection
of both capitalism and communism
seemed to place him in a situation in which he could not live with satisfaction either in the united states
or in the soviet union
the discussion above has already set forth examples of his expression of hatred for the united states
he also expressed hatred of the soviet union
and of the communest party u s say
even though he later referred to the latter as quote trusted long time fighters for progress and quote
he wrote quoth
the communist party of the united states has betrayed itself
it has turned itself into the traditional lever
of a foreign power
to overthrow the government of the united states
not in the name of freedom or high ideals
but in servile conformity to the wishes of the soviet union
and in anticipation of soviet russia's complete domination of the american continent
there can be no sympathy for those who have turned the idea of communism into a vile curse to western man
the soviets have committed crimes unsurpassed even by their early day capitalist counterparts
the imprisonment of their own peoples
with the mass extermination so typical of staling
and the individual suppression and regimentation under kruschev
the deportations the purposeful curtailment of diet in the consumer slighted population of russia
the murder of history
the prostitution of art and culture
and quoth
a suggestion that oswald hated more than just capitalism and communism
is provided by the following
which was apparently written either on the ship coming back
or after his return from the soviet union
quote
i have often wondered why it is that the communist
anarchist capitalist
and even the fashest and anarchist elements in american
always profess patriotism toward the land and the people
if not the government
although their ideals movements
must surely lead
to the bitter destruction of all and everything
i am quite sure these people must hate not only the government
but hour the people culture
traditions
heritage
and very people itself
and yet
they stand up and piously pronounce themselves patriots
displaying their war metdals
that they gained in conflicts long passed between themselves
i wonder what would happen if somebody was to stand up and say he was utterly opposed not only to the governments but to the people
to the entire land
and complete foundations of his society
and quoth
oswald demonstrated his thinking in connection with his return to the united states
by preparing two sets of identical questions of the type which he might have thought
he would be asked at a press conference when he returned
with either great ambivalence or cold calculation
he prepared completely different answers to the same questions
judged by his other statements and writings however
he appears to have indicated his true feelings
in the set of answers first presented
and to have stated in the second what he thought would be least harmful to him
as he resumed life in the united states
for example
in response to his questions about his decision to go to the soviet union

his first draught answered quote
as a mark of disgust and protest against american political policies in foreign countries
my personal sign of discontent
and horror
at the misguided line of reasoning of the united states
government and quote
his second answer was that he quote
went as a citizen of the u s as a tourist
residing in a foreign country which i have a perfect right to do
i went there to see the land
the people and how their system works and quote
to the question of quoth
are you a communist
and quoth he first answered yes
bpasically although i hate the u ses are in socialist system i still think markism can work under different circumstances
and quoth

his second answer to this question was quote
no of course not
i have never even known a communist outside of the ones in the uses are but you can't help that  quote
his first set of questions and answers indicated his belief
that there were no outstanding differences between the soviet union of the united states
quote except in the u s
the living standard is a little higher
freedoms are about the same
medical aid and the educational system in the u s es are is better than in the u s a and quote
in the second simulated transcript which ended with the statement quote newspapers
thank you sir you are a real patriot and quoth
he apparently concluded that the united states offered quote
freedom of speech travel outspoken opposition to unpopular policies
freedom to believe in god and quote
while the soviet union did not
despite the hatred that oswald expressed toward the soviet union after his residence there
he continued to be interested in that country after he returned to the united states
soon after his arrival
he wrote to the soviet embassy in washington
requesting information on how to subscribe to russian newspapers and magazines and asked for quote
oswald subsequently did subscribe to several soviet journals
while marina oswald tried to obtain permission to return to the soviet union
she testified that she did so at her husband's insistence
in july of nineteen sixty three
oswald also requested the soviet union to provide a viza for his return to that country
in august of nineteen sixty three
he gave the new orleans police as a reason for refusing to permit his family to learn english
that quote
he hated america
and he did not want them to become americanized
and that his plans were to go back to russia
and quoth
even though his primary purpose probably was to get to cuba
he sought an immediate grant of viza on his trip to mexico city in late september of nineteen sixty three
he also inquired about vesus for himself and his wife

background and possible motives part four
personal relations
apart from his relatives oswald had no friends or close associates in texas when he returned there in june of nineteen sixty two
and he did not establish any close friendships or associations although it appears that he came to respect george de marenshilt
somewhat of a nonconformist
de maren schilt was a periferal member of the so called russian community with which oswald made contact through mister peter gregory
a russian speaking petroleum engineer whom oswald met as a result of his contact with the texas employment commission office in fort worth
some of the members of that group saw a good deal of the oswalds through the fall of nineteen sixty three
and attempted to help missus oswald particularly in various ways in general oswald did not like the members of the russian community
in fact his relations with some of them particularly george bull became quite hostile
part of the problem resulted from the fact that as jeane de marenshalt testified
oswald was quote very very disagreeable and disappointed and quote
he also expressed considerable resentment at the help given to his wife by her russian american friends
jeane de marenschelt said quote
marina had a hundred dresses given to her and he objected to that lavish help because marina was throwing it into his face
he was offensive with the people and i can understand why because that hurt him
he could never give her what the people were showering on her no matter how hard he worked and he worked very hard and quote
the relations between oswald and his wife became such that buoa wanted to liberate her from oswald
while the exact sequence of events is not clear because of conflicting testimony
it appears that de morenschilt and his wife actually went to oswald's apartment early in november of nineteen sixty two
and helped to move the personal effects of marina oswald and the baby
even though it appears that they may have left oswald a few days before it seems that he resisted the move as best he could
he even threatened to tear up his wife's ddresses and break all the baby things according to de marenschelt
oswald submitted to the inevitable presumably because he was quote small you know and he was rather a puny individual and quote
de marinschelt said that the whole affair made him nervous since he was quote interfering in other people's affairs after all and quote
oswald attempted to get his wife to come back and over boo's protest de maren schilt finally told him where she was
de morens schelt admitted that quote
if somebody did that to me a lousy trick like that to take my wife away and all the furniture i would be mad as hell too
i am surprised that he didn't do something worse and quote
after about a two weeks separation marina oswald returned to her husband
bo thoroughly disapproved of this and as a result almost all communication between the oswalds and members of the russian community ceased
contacts with damaranschilt and his wife did continue and they saw the oswald occasionally until the spring of nineteen sixty three
shortly after his return from the soviet union
oswald severed all relations with his mother
he did not see his brother robert from thanksgiving of nineteen sixty two until november twenty three nineteen sixty three
at the time of his defection oswald had said that neither his brother robert
nor his mother were objects of his affection quote but only examples of workers in the u s and quote
he also indicated to officials at the american embassy in moscow that his defection was motivated at least in part
by so called exploitation of his mother by the capitalist system
consistent with this attitude
he first told his wife that he did not have a mother but later admitted that he did but that quote he didn't love her very much andqu
when they arrived from the soviet union oswald and his family lived at first with his brother robert
the latter testified that they quote were just together again and quote as if his brother quote had not been to russia
he also said that he and his family got along well with marina oswald and enjoyed showing her american things
after about a month with his brother
oswald and his family lived for a brief period with his mother at her urging but oswald soon decided to move out
marguerite oswald visited her son and his family at the first apartment which he rented after his return and tried to help them get settled there
after she had bought some clothes for marina oswald and a high chair for the baby oswald emphatically told her to stop
as marguerite oswald testified quote
he strongly put me in my place about buying things for his wife that he himself could not buy and quote
oswald objected to his mother visiting the apartment
and became quite incensed with his wife when she would open the door for her in spite of his instructions to the contrary
oswald moved to dalis on about october eighth nineteen sixty two without telling his mother where he was going
he never saw or communicated with her in any way again until she came to see him after the assassination
even though oswald cut off relations with his mother
he attempted for the first time to learn something about his family background when he went to new orleans in april of nineteen sixty three
he visited some of his father's elderly relatives and the cemetery where his father was buried in an effort to develop the facts of his genealogy
while it does not appear that he established any new relationships as a result of his investigation he did obtain a large picture of his father
from one of the elderly relatives with whom he spoke
oswald's interest in such things presents a sharp contrast with his attitude
at the time of his defection when he evidenced no interest in his father and hardly mentioned him even when questioned
oswald's defection his interest in the soviet union and his activities on behalf of the fair play for cuba committee
not only caused him difficulties in his employment relations but they also provided him with excuses for employment failures
which were largely of his own making
oswald experienced some difficulty finding employment perhaps this was partially because of his lack of any specific skill or training
some of his acquaintances feeling that oswald tried to impress people with the fact that he had lived and worked in russia were led to the belief
that his employment difficulties were caused by his telling prospective employers that he had last been employed in misk
while he might have expected difficulty from such an approach in fact
the evidence indicates that oswald usually told his prospective employers and employment counsellors that he had recently been discharged from the marine corps
oswald obtained a job in july of nineteen sixty two as a sheep metal worker with a company in fortworth
his performance for that company was satisfactory
even though he told his wife that he had been fired he voluntarily left on october eighth nineteen sixty two and moved to dalus
on october ninth nineteen sixty two he went to the dallass office of the texas employment commission
where he expressed a reluctance to work in the industrial field
he indicated an interest in writing an employment counsellor testified on the basis of a general aptitude test oswald had taken
that he had some aptitude in that area coat because the verbal score is high and the clerical score is high and quote
while that counsellor found that he was qualified to handle many different types of jobs
because of is need for immediate employment she attempted to obtain for him any job that was available at the time oswald made qualifying marks
in nineteen of twenty three categories included on the general aptitude examination and scored one hundred twenty seven on the verbal test as compared
with fifty per cent of the people taking it whoe score less than one hundred
the counsellor testified that there was some indication that oswald was capable of doing college work
and noted that oswald's verbal and clerical potential was quote outstanding n
employment commission records concerning oswald stated quote well groomed and spoken
business suit alert replies expresses self extremely well and quote
oswald said that he hoped eventually to develop qualifications for employment as a junior executive
through a work study programme at a local college
he indicated however that he would have to delay that programme because of his immediate financial needs and responsibilities
on october eleventh nineteen sixty two the employment commission referred oswald
to a commercial advertising photography firm in dawlis where he was employed as a trainy starting october twelfth nineteen sixty two
even though oswald indicated that he liked photographic work his employer found that he was not an efficient worker
he was not able to produce photographic work
which adhered with sufficient precision to the job specifications and as a result too much of his work had to be red done
he also had difficulty in working with the other employees
this was at least in part because of the close physical confines in which some of the work had to be done
he did not seem to be able to make the accommodations necessary when people work under such conditions and as a result
became involved in conflicts some of which were fairly heated with his fellow employees
in february or march of nineteen sixty three
it began to appear that oswald was having considerable difficulty doing accurate work and in getting along with the other employees
it appears that his discharge was hastened by the fact that he brought a russian language newspaper to work
it is not possible to tell whether oswald did this to provide an excuse for his eventual discharge
or whether he brought the russian language newspaper with him one day after his other difficulties became clear
it is possible that his immediate supervisor noticed the newspaper at that time because his attention had otherwise been drawn more directly to oswald
in any event oswald was discharged on april sixth nineteen sixty three
ostensibly because of his inefficiency and difficult personality
his supervisor admitted however
that while he did not fire oswald because of the newspaper incident or even weigh idt heavily in his decision quote
it didn't do his case any good and quote
upon moving to new orleans on april twenty fourth nineteen sixty three
oswald's employment problems became more difficult he left his wife and child at the home of a friend missus rufe payne of irving texas
in new orleans he obtained work as a greacer and oiler of coffee processing machines for the william b riley company
beginning may tenth nineteen sixty three
after securing this job and an apartment oswald asked his wife to join him
missus payne brought oswald's family to new orleans
refusing to admit that he could only get work as a graecer
oswald told his wife and missus payne that he was working as a commercial photographer
he lost his job on july nineteenth nineteen sixty three because his work was not satisfactory
and because he spent too much time loitering in the garage next door where he read rifle and hunting magazines
oswald apparently concluded that his fair play for cuba committee activities were not related to his discharge
the correctness of that conclusion is supported by the fact that he does not seem to have been publicly identified with that organization until august ninth
nineteen sixty three almost a month after he lost his job
his fair play for cuba committee activities however made it more difficult for him to obtain other employment
a placement interviewer of the louisiana department of labor
who had previously interviewed oswald saw him on television and heard a radio debate in which he engaged on august twenty onth nineteen sixty three
he consulted with his supervisor and quote it was determined that we should not undertake to furnish employment references for him and quote
ironically he failed to get a job in another photographic firm after his return to dalis in october of nineteen sixty three
because the president of the photographic firm for which he had previously worked
told the prospective employer that oswold was quote kind of peculiar sometimes and that he had some knowledge of the russian language and quote
and that he quote may be a damned communist i can't tell you if i was you i wouldn't hire him and quote
the plant superintendent of the new firm testified that one of the employees of the old firm quote
implied that oswald's fellow employees did not like him because he was propagandizing
and had been seen reading a foreign newspaper and quote
as a result oswald was not hired
he subsequently found a job with the texas school book depository for which he performed his duties satisfactorily
attack on general walker
the commission has concluded that on april tenth nineteen sixty three
oswald shot at major general edwin a walker resigned you as army
demonstrating once again his propensity to act dramatically and in this instance violently in furtherance of his beliefs
the shooting occurred two weeks before oswald moved to new orleans and a few days after he had been discharged by the photographic firm
as indicated in chapter four oswald had been planning his attack on general walker for at least one and perhaps as much as two months
he outlined his plans in a note book
and studied them at considerable length before his attack
he also studied dalliss bu schedules to prepare for his later use of buses to travel to and from general walker's house
some time after march twenty seven but according to marina oswald prior to april tenth nineteen sixty three
oswald posed for two pictures
with his recently acquired rifle and pistol a copy of the march twenty fourth nineteen sixty three issue of the worker
and the march eleventh nineteen sixty three issue of the militant
he told his wife that he wanted to send the pictures to the militant and he also asked her to keep one of the pictures for his daughter june
following his unsuccessful attack on walker
aswald returned home
he had left a note for his wife telling her what to do in case he were apprehended as well as his note book and the pictures of himself holding the rifle
she testified that she was agitated because she had found the note in oswald's room
where she had gone contrary to his instructions after she became worried about his absence
she indicated that she had no advance knowledge of oswald's plans
that she became quite angry when oswald told her what he had done and that she made him promise never to repeat such a performance
she said that she kept the note to use against him quote if something like that should be repeated again and quote
when asked if oswald requested the note back she testified that quote he forgot about it but apparently
after he thought that what he had written in his book might be proof against him and he destroyed it
the bock andqu
she later gave the following testimony
question
after he brought the rifle home then he showed you the book
answer yes
question and you said it was not a good idea to keep this book answer yes
question and then he burned the book
answer yes
question did you ask him why he had not destroyed the book before he actually went to shoot general walker
answer it never came to me myself to ask him that question
marina oswald's testimony indicates that her husband was not particularly concerned about his continued possession of the most incriminating sort of evidence
if he had been successful and had been apprehended even for routine questioning his apartment would undoubtedly have been searched
and his role would have been made clear by the evidence which he had left behind
leaving the note and picture as he did would seem to indicate that he had considered the possibility of capture
possibly he might have wanted to be caught and wanted his involvement made clear if he was in fact apprehended
even after his wife told him to destroy the note book
he removed at least some of the pictures which had been pasted in it and saved them among his effects where they were found after the assassination
his behaviour was entirely consistent with his wife's testimony that quote
i asked him what for he was making all these entries in the book and he answered that he wanted to leave a complete record so that all the details would be in it
i am guessing that perhaps he did it to appear to be a brave man in case he were arrested but that is my supposition and quote
the attempt on general walker's life deserves close attention in any consideration of oswald's possible motive for the assassination
and the trail of evidence he left behind him on that occasion
while there are differences between the two events as far as oswald's actions and planning are concerned there are also similarities that should be considered
the items which oswald left at home when he made his attack on walker suggest a strong concern for his place in history
if the attack had succeeded and oswald had been caught the pictures showing him with his rifle
and his communist and socialist workers parting newspapers would probably have appeared on the front pages of newspapers or magazines all over the country
as in fact one of them did appear after the assassination
the circumstances of the attack on walker coupled with other indications that oswald was concerned about his place in history
and with the circumstances surrounding the assassination have led the commission to believe
that such concern is an important factor to consider in assessing possible motivation for the assassination
in any event the walker incident indicates that in spite of the belief among those who knew him that he was apparently not dangerous
oswald did not lack the determination and other traits required
to carry out a carefully planned killing of another human being and was willing to consummate such a purpose if he thought there was sufficient reason to do so
some idea of what he thought was sufficient reason for such an act may be found in the nature of the motive that he stated for his attack on general walker
marina oswald indicated that her husband had compared general walker to adolf hittler
she testified that oswald said the general walker quote
was a very bad man that he was a fashest
that he was the leader of a fashiest organization and when i said that even though all that might be true just the same he had no right to take his life

lee harvey oswald background and possible motives part five
political activities
oswald's political activities after his return to the united states cent her around his interest in cuba and in the fair play for cuba committee
although as indicated above the commission has been unable to find any credible evidence
that he was involved in any conspiracy his political activities do provide in sight into certain aspects of oswald's character
and into his possible motivation for the assassination
while it appears that he may have distributed fair play for cuba committee materials on one uneventful occasion in dowless sometimes during the period
april six to twenty four nineteen sixty three oswald's first public identification with that cause was in new orleans
there in late may and early june of nineteen sixty three under the name lee osborne
he had printed a handbill headed in large letters quote
hands off cuba and quote an application form four and a membership card in
the new orleans branch of the fair play for cuba committee
he first distributed his handbills and other material uneventfully in the vicinity of the u s s wasp
which was birthed at the domain street wharf in new orleans on june sixteenth nineteen sixty three
he distributed literature in downtown new orleans on august ninth nineteen sixty three
and was arrested because of a dispute with three anticastrol cuban exiles and again on august sixteenth nineteen sixty three
following his arrest
he was interviewed by the police and at his own request by an agent of the f be i
on august seventeenth nineteen sixty three he appeared briefly on a radio programme and on august twenty onth nineteen sixty three
he debated over radio station w d s yu new orleans with carlos bringweir
one of the cuban exiles who had been arrested with him on august ninth
bring we are claimed that on august five nineteen sixty three
oswald had attempted to infiltrate an anticastoro organization with which he was associated
while oswald publicly engaged in the activities described above his quote organization and quote was a product of his imagination
the imaginary president of the non existent chapter was named a j hadel the name that oswald used when he purchased the assassination weapon
marina oswald said she signed that name apparently chosen because it rhymed with fidel
to her husband's membership card in the new orleans chapter
she testified that he threatened to beat her if she did not do so the chapter had never been chartered by the national f p c c organization
it appears to have been a solitary operation on oswald's part in spite of his misstatements to the new orleans police that it had thirty five members
five of which were usually present at meetings which were held once a month
oswald's fair play for cuba activities may be viewed as a very shrewd political operation
in which one man single handedly created publicity for his cause or for himself
it is also evidence of oswald's reluctance to describe events accurately
and of his need to present himself to others as well as to himself in a light more favorable than was justified by reality
this is suggested by his misleading and sometimes untruthful statements in his letters to mister v t lee
then national director of f p c c
in one of those letters dated august onth nineteen sixty three
oswald wrote that an office which he had previously claimed to have rented for f p c c activities had been quote
promptly closed three days later for some obscure reasons by the renters
they said something about remodelling et cetera i'm sure you understand and quote
he wrote that quote thousands of circulars were distributed and quote
and that he continued to receive inquiries through his post office box which he endeavored quote to keep answering to the best of my ability and quote
in his letter to v t ly
he stated that he was then alone in his efforts on behalf of f p c c but he attributed his lack of support
to an attack by cuban exiles in a street demonstration and being quote officially cautioned and quote by the police
events which quote robbed me of what support i had leaving me alone and quote
that anyone ever attacked any street demonstration in which oswald was involved except for the bringweare incident mentioned above
which occurred eight days after oswald wrote the above letter to v t lee
brengwar who seemed to be familiar with many anticastoro activities in new orleans was not aware of any such incident
police reports also fail to reflect any activity on oswald's part prior to august ninth nineteen sixty three
except for the uneventful distribution of literature at the domain street wharf in june
furthermore the general tenor of oswald's next letter to v t lee
in which he supported his report on the brainwar incident with a copy of the charges made against him
and a newspaper clipping reporting the event
suggests that his previous story of an attack by cuban exiles was at least greatly exaggerated
while the legend quote f p c c five four four camp street new orleans louisiana and quote
was stamped on some literature that oswald had in his possession at the time of his arrest in new orleans
extensive investigation was not able to connect oswald with that address although it did develop the fact
that an anti castorol organization had maintained offices there for a period ending early in nineteen sixty two
the commission has not been able to find any other indication that oswald had rented an office in new orleans
in view of the limited amount of public activity on oswald's part before august ninth nineteen sixty three
there also seems to be no basis for his claim that he had distributed quote
thousands and quote of circulars especially since he had claimed to have printed only two thousand
and actually had only one thousand printed
in addition there is no evidence that he received any substantial amount of materials from the national headquarters
in another letter to v t lee dated august seventeenth nineteen sixty three
oswald wrote that he had appeared on mister william stucky's fifteen minute television programme over w d s u t thee called quote
latin american focus and quote
as a result of which he was quote flooded with collars and invitations to debates et cetera as well as people interested in joining the f p c c
new orleans branch and quote
w d s you has no program of any kind called quote latin american focus and quote
stucky had a radio programme called quote latin listening post and quote
on which oswald was heard for less than five minutes on august seventeenth nineteen sixty three
it appears that oswald had only one collar in response to all of his f p c c activities
an agent of bringwears attempting to learn more about the true nature
of the alleged f p c c quote organization and quote in new orleans
oswald's statements suggest that he hoped to be flooded with callers and invitations to debate
this would have made him a real centre of attention as he must have been when he first arrived in the soviet union
and as he was to some extent when he returned to the united states
the limited notoriety that oswald received as a result of the street fracas and in the subsequent radio debate
was apparently not enough to satisfy him he exaggerated in his letters to v t lee in an apparent attempt
to make himself and his activities appear far more important than they really were
his attempt to express himself through his fair play for cuba activities however
was greatly impeded by the fact that the radio debate over w d s ou on august twenty onth nineteen sixty three
brought out the history of his defection to the soviet union
the basic facts of the event were uncovered independently by william stuckey who arranged the debate and edward putler
executive director of the information council of the americas who also appeared on the programme
oswald was confronted with those facts at the beginning of the debate and was so thrown on the defensive by this that he was forced to state that
fair play for cuba was quote not at all communist controlled regardless of the fact that i had the experience of living in russia and quote
stuckey testified that uncovering oswald's defection was very important quote
i think that we finished him on that programme because we had publicly linked the fair play for cuba committee
with a fellow who had lived in russia for three years and who was an admitted marksist
the interesting thing or rather the danger involved was the fact that oswald seemed like such a nice bright boy
and was extremely believable before this we thought the fellow could probably get quite a few members if he was really indeed serious about getting members
we figured after this broadcast of august twenty one why that was no longer possible and quote
in spite of the fact that oswald had been surprised and was on the defensive throughout the debate according to stockey quote
mister oswald handled himself very well as usual and quote
stucky thought oswald quote appeared to be a very logical intelligent fellow and quote and quote was arrested by his clean cutness and coat
he did not think oswald looked like the quot type and quote that he would have expected to find associating with a group such as the fair play for cuba committee
stucky thought that oswald acted very much as would a young attorney
following the disclosure of his defection oswald sought advice from the communist party u s a concerning his fair play for cuba activity
he had previously sent apparently unsolicited to the party newspaper the worker
samples of his photographic work offering to contribute that sort of service without charge
the worker replied quote your kind offer is most welcomed and from time to time we shall call on you and quote
he laid her wrote to another official of the worker seeking employment and mentioning the praise he had received for submitting his photographic work
he presented arnold johnson gus hull
and benjamin ja davis honorary membership cards in his non existent new orleans chapter of the fair play for cuba committee
and advised them of some of his activities on behalf of the organization
arnold johnson director of the information and lecture bureau of the communist party u s ay replied stating quote
it is good to know that movements in support of fair play for cuba has developed in new orleans as well as in other cities
we do not have any organizational ties with the committee and yet there is much material that we issue from time to time that is important
for anybody who is concerned about developments in cuba and quot
marina oswald said that such correspondence from people he considered important meant much to oswald
after he had begun his cuban activity in new orleans quote
he received a letter from somebody in new york some communist probably from new york i am not sure from where from some communist leader and he was very happy
he felt that this was a great man that he had received a letter from and quote
since he seemed to feel that no one else understood his political views the letter was of great value to him for it quote
was proof
that there were people who understood his activity and quote
he anticipated that the full disclosure of his defection would hinder him and quoth the struggle for progress and freedom in the united states and quote
into which oswald and his own words had quoe thrown himself he sought advice from the central committee of the communist party u s ay
in a letter dated august twenty eighth nineteen sixty three about whether he could quote continue to fight
handicapped as it were by my past record and compete with anti progressive forces above ground or whether in your opinion
i should always remain in the background i e underground and quote
stating that he had used his position with what he claimed to be the local branch of the fair play for cuba committee to quote foster communist ideals and quote
oswald wrote that he felt that he might have compromised the f p c c and expressed concern lest quote our opponents could use my background
of residence in the u s s are against any cause which i join by association
they could say the organization of which i am a member is russian controlled et cetera and quot
in reply arnold johnson advised oswald that while as an american citizen he had a right to participate in such organizations as he wished quote
there are a number of organizations including possibly fair play which are of a very broad character
and often it is advisable for some people to remain in the background not underground and quote
by august of nineteen sixty three after a short three months in new orleans the city in which he had been born and had lived most of his early life
oswald had fallen on difficult times
he had not liked his job as a greacer of coffee processing machinery and he held it for only a little over two months
he had not found another job his wife was expecting their second child in october and there was concern about the cost which would be involved
his brief foray on behalf of the fair play for cuba committee had failed to win any support
while he had drawn some attention to himself and had actually appeared on two radio programmes he had been attacked by cuban exiles and arrested
an event which his wife thought upset him and as a result of which quote he became less active he cooled off a little and qu
more seriously the facts of his defection had become known leaving him open to almost unanswerable attack by those who opposed his views
it would not have been possible to have followed arnold johnson's advice to remain in the background
since there was no background to the new orleans f p c c quote organization and quote which consisted solely of oswald
furthermore he had apparently not received any letters from the national headquarters of f p c c since may twenty ninth nineteen sixty three
even though he had written four detailed letters since that time to mister v t lee and had also kept the national headquarters informed
of each of his changes of mailing address
those events no doubt had their effects on oswald
interest in cuba
by august of nineteen sixty three oswald had for some time been considering the possibility of leaving the united states again
on june twenty fourth nineteen sixty three he applied for a new passport
and in late june or early july he told his wife that he wanted to return to the soviet union with her she said that he was extremely upset
very unhappy and that he actually wept when he told her that
he said that nothing kept him in the united states that he would not lose anything if he returned to the soviet union that he wanted to be with her
and that it would be better to have less and not to have to be concerned about to morrow
as a result of that conversation marina oswald wrote the soviet embassy in washington concerning a request she had first made
on february seventeenth nineteen sixty three for permission for herself and june to return to the soviet union
while that first request made according to marina oswald at her husband's insistence specifically stated that oswald was to remain in the united states
she wrote in her letter of july nineteen sixty three
that things are improving due to the fact that my husband expresses a sincere wish to return together with me to the u s s ar unknown to his wife however
oswald apparently enclosed a note with her letter of july in which
he requested the embassy to rush his wife's entrance viza because of the impending birth of the second child but stated that quote
as for my return entrance viza please consider it separately and quote
thus while oswald's real intentions assuming that they were known to himself are not clear
he may not have intended to go to the soviet union directly if at all it appears that he really wanted to go to cuba
in his wife's words quote
i only know that his basic desire was to get to cuba by any means and that all the rest of it was window dressing for that purpose and quth
marina oswald testified that her husband engaged in fair play for cuba committee activities quote
primarily for purposes of self advertising
he wanted to be arrested i think he wanted to get into the newspapers so that he would be known and quote
according to marina oswald he thought that would help him when he got to cuba
he asked his wife to help him to hide jack and aeroplane to get there but gave up that scheme when she refused
during this period oswald may have practised opening and closing the bolt on his rifle in a screened porch in his apartment
in september he began to review spanish
he approved arrangements for his family to return to irving texas to live with missus ruth payne
on september twenty nineteen sixty three missus payne and her two children arrived in new orleans from a trip to the east coast
and left for irving with marina oswald and june and most of the oswald's effects three days later
while marina oswald knew of her husband's plan to go to mexico and thence to cuba if possible missus payne was told that oswald was going to houston
and possibly to philadelphia to look for work
oswald left for mexico city on september twenty five nineteen sixty three and arrived on september twenty seventh nineteen sixty three
he went almost directly to the cuban embassy and applied for eviza to cuba in transit to russia
representing himself as the head of the new orleans branch of the quote organization called fair play for cuba
and quote
he stated his desire that he should be accepted as a friend of the cuban revolution
he apparently based his claim for a viza in transit to russia
on his previous residence his work permit for that country and several unidentified letters in the russian language
the cubans would not however give him a viza until he had received one from the soviets which involved a delay of several months
when faced with that situation oswald became greatly agitated and although he later unsuccessfully attempted
to obtain a soviet viza at the soviet embassy in mexico city he insisted that he was entitled to the cuban vesa because of his background
partisanship and personal activities on behalf of the cuban government
he engaged in an angry argument with the consul who finally told him that quote as far as he was concerned
he would not give him a viza and quote and that quote
a person like him oswald in place of aiding the cuban revolution was doing it harm and quote
oswald must have been thoroughly disillusioned when he left mexico city on october two nineteen sixty three
in spite of his former residence in the soviet union and his fair play for cuba committee activities he had been rebuffed
by the officials of both cuba and the soviet union in mexico city
now there appeared to be no chance to get to cuba where he had thought he might find his communist ideal
the u s government would not permit travel there
and as far as the performance of the cubans themselves was concerned he was quote disappointed at not being able to get to cuba
and he didn't have any great desire to do so any more because he had run into as he himself said into bureaucracy and red tape and quit
oswald's attempt to go to cuba
was another act which expressed his hostility toward the united states and its institutions as well as a concomitant attachment
to a country in which he must have thought were embodied the political principles to which he had been committed for so long
it should be noted that his interest in cuba seems to have increased along with the sense of frustration which must have developed
as he experienced successive failures in his jobs in whose political activity and in his personal relationships
in retrospect his attempt to go to cuba or return to the soviet union may well have been oswald's last escape hatch
his last gambut to extricate himself from the mediocrity and defeat which plagued him throughout most of his life
oswalds activities with regard to cuba raised serious questions as to how much he might have been motivated in the assassination
by a desire to aid the castoral regime which president kennedy so outspokenly criticised
for example the dallest times herald of november nineteenth nineteen sixty three
prominently reported president kennedy as having quote all but invited the cuban people to day to overthrow fidel castro's communist regime
and promised prompt u s aid if they do and quote
the castorol regimes severely attacked president kennedy in connection with the bay of pigs affair the cuban missile crisis the ban on travel to cuba
the economic in bargo against that country and the general policy of the united states with regard to cuba
an examination of the militant to which oswald subscribed
for the three month period prior to the assassination reflects an extremely critical attitude toward president kennedy and his administration
concerning cuban policy in general as well as on the issues of automation an civil rights
issues which appeared to concern oswald a great deal
the militant also reflected a critical attitude toward president kennedy's attempts to reduce tensions between the united states and the soviet union
it also dealt with the fear of the castoral regime that such a policy might result in its abandonment by the soviet union
the october seventh nineteen sixty three issue of ta militant
reported castro as saying cuba could not accept a situation
where at the same time the united states was trying to ease world tensions
it also was increasing its efforts to tighten the noose around cuba
was also reported in the october one nineteen sixty three issue of the worker to which oswald also subscribed
in this connection it should be noted that in speaking of the worker oswald told michael payne apparently in all seriousness that quote
you could tell what they wanted you to do by reading between the lines reading the thing and doing a little reading between the lines and quote
the general conflict of views between the united states an cuba was of course reflected in other media to such an extent
that there can be no doubt
that oswald was aware generally
of the critical attitude that castro expressed
about president kennedy
oswald was asked during the new orleans radio debate in which he engaged on august twenty onth nineteen sixty three
whether or not he agreed with castro that president kennedy was a quote ruffian and a thief and quothe he replied that he quote
would not agree with that particular wording and quothe
it should also be noted however that one witness testified that shortly before the assassination
oswald had expressed approval of president kennedy's active role in the area of civil rights
although oswald could possibly have been motivated in part by his sympathy for the castoral government
it should be remembered that his wife testified that he was disappointed with his failure to get to cuba
and had lost his desire to do so because of the bureaucracy and red tape which he had encountered
his unhappy experience with the cuban consul seems thus to have reduced his enthusiasm for the castoral regime and his desire to go to cuba
while some of castros more severe criticisms of president kennedy might have led oswald to believe that he would be well received in cuba
after he had assassinated the american president it does not appear that he had any plans to go there
oswald was carrying only thirteen dollars eighty seven cents at the time of his arrest although he had left apparently by design
one hundred seventy dollars in a wallet in his wife's room in irving
if there was no conspiracy which would help him escape the possibility of which has been considered in chapter six
it is unlikely that a reasoning person would plan to attempt to travel from dallas texas to cuba
with thirteen dollars eighty seven cents when considerably greater resources were available to him
the fact that oswald left behind the funds which might have enabled him to reach cuba suggests the absence of any plan to try to flee there
and raises serious questions as to whether or not he ever expected to escape

lee harvey oswald
background and possible motives part six
possible influence of anti kennedy sentiment endowis
it has been suggested that one of the motivating influences operating on leoswald was the atmosphere in the city of dalis
especially an atmosphere of extreme opposition to president kennedy that was present in some parts of the dallist community
and which received publicity there prior to the assassination
some of that feeling was expressed in the incident involving then vice presidential candidate johnson during the nineteen sixty campaign
in the treatment of ambassador adelaide stevenson late in october of nineteen sixty three
and in the extreme anti kennedy newspaper advertisement in handbills that appeared in dawlis at the time of the president's visit there
the commission has found no evidence that the extreme views expressed toward president kennedy
by some right wing groups centred in dalis or any other general atmosphere of hate
or right wing extremism which may have existed in the city of dalis had any connection with oswald's actions on november twenty two nineteen sixty three
there is of course no way to judge what the effect of the general political ferment present in that city might have been even though oswald was aware of it
his awareness is shown by a letter that he wrote to arnold johnson of the communist party u s say
which johnson said he did not receive until after the assassination the letters said in part quote
on october twenty third i had attended a ultrarite meeting headed by general edwin a walker who lives in dawlis
this meeting preceded by one day the attack on a e stevenson at the united nation's day meeting at which he spoke
as you can see political friction between left and right is very great here
could you advise me as to the general view we have on the american civil libertye's union and quote
in any event the commission has been unable to find any credible evidence that oswald had direct contact or association with
any of the personalities or groups epitomizing or representing the so called right wing
even though he did as he told johnson attend a meeting at which general walker spoke too approximately thirteen hundred persons
oswald's writings and his reading habits indicate that he had an extreme dislike of the right wing an attitude most clearly reflected by his attempt
to shoot general walker
relationship with wife
the relations between lee and marina oswald are of great importance in any attempt to understand oswald's possible motivation
during the period from oswald's return from mexico to the assassination
he and his wife spent every week end but one together at the irving texas home of missus ruth payne who was then separated from her husband
the sole exception was the week end of november sixteenth to seventeen nineteen sixty three there weakened before the assassination
when his wife asked oswald not to come to irving
during the week oswald lived in a rooming house in dalis but he usually called his wife on the telephone twice a day
she testified that after his return from mexico
oswald quote changed for the better
he began to treat me better he helped me more although he always did help but he was more attentive and quote
marina oswald attributed that to their living apart and to the imminent birth of their second child
she testified that oswald quote was very happy and quote about the birth of the child
while those considerations no doubt had an effect on oswald's attitude toward his family it would seem that the need for support and sympathy
after his recent rebuffs in mexico city
might also have been important to him it would not have been the first time that oswald sought closer ties with his family in time of adversity
his past relationships with his wife had been stormy however and it did not seem that she respected him very much
they had been married after a courtship of only about six weeks a part of which oswald spent in the hospital
oswald's diary reports that he married his wife shortly after his proposal of marriage to another girl had been rejected
he stated that the other girl rejected him partly because he was an american a fact that he said she had exploited he stated that quote
in spite of fact i married marina to hurt ella the girl that had rejected him
i found myself in love with marina and quote
many of the people with whom the oswalds became acquainted after their arrival in the united states thought that marina oswald had married her husband primarily in the hope
that she would be able to leave the soviet union marina oswald has denied this
marina oswald expressed one aspect of her husband's attitude toward her when she testified that quote lee wanted me to go to russia
and i told him that
if he wanted me to go then that meant that he didn't love me and that in that case what was the idea of coming to the united states in the first place
lee would say that it would be better for me if i went to russia i did not know why i did not know what he had in mind
he said he loved me but that it would be better for me if i went to russia and what he had in mind i don't know
and quote
on the other hand oswald objected to the invitation that his wife had received to live with missus ruth payne
which missus payine had made in part to give her an alternative to returning to the soviet union marina oswald wrote to missus payne that quote
many times oswald has recalled this matter to me and said that i am just waiting for an opportunity to hurt him
it has been the cause of many of our arguments and quote oswald claimed that his wife preferred others to him
he said this about members of the russian speaking group in the dallis fortworth area whom she said he tried to forbid her from seeing
and also about missus payne
he specifically made that claim when his wife refused to come to live with him in dalis as he asked her to do on the evening of november twenty one
nineteen sixty three
the instability of their relations was probably a function of the personalities of both people oswald was overbearing in relations with his wife
he apparently attempted to be the commander by dictating many of the details of their married life
while marina oswald said that her husband wanted her to learn english
he made no attempt to help her and there are other indications that he did not want her to learn that language
oswald apparently wished to continue practising his own russian with her
lieutenant martello of the new orleans police testified
that oswald stated that he did not speak english in his family because he did not want them to become americanized
marina oswald's inability to speak english also made it more difficult for her to have an independent existence in this country
oswald struck his wife on occasion
did not want her to drink smoke or wear cosmetics and generally treated her with lack of respect in the presence of others
the difficulties which oswald's problems would have caused him in any relationship were probably not reduced by his wife's conduct
catharine ford with whom marina oswald stayed during her separation from her husband in november of nineteen sixty two
thought that marina oswald was immature in her thinking
and partly responsible for the difficulties that the oswalds were having at that time
missus ford said that marina oswald admitted that she provoked oswald on occasion
there can be little doubt that some provocation existed
oswald once struck his wife because of a letter which she wrote to a former boy friend in russia
in the letter marina oswald stated that her husband had changed a great deal and that she was very lonely in the united states
she was quote sorry that i had not married him the russian boy friend instead that it would have been much easier for me and quote
the letter fell into oswald's hands when it was returned to his post office box
because of insufficient postage which apparently resulted from an increase in postal rates of which his wife had been unaware
oswald read the letter but refused to believe that it was sincere even though his wife insisted to him that it was
as a result oswald struck her as to which she testified quote
generally i think that was right for such things that is the right thing to do there was some grounds for it and
although she denied it in some of her testimony before the commission
it appears that marina oswald also complained that her husband was not able to provide more material things for her
on that issue george de maranschilt who was probably as close to the oswald as any one else during their first stay in dawlis
said that quote she was annoying him all the time
why don't you make some money poor guy was going out of his mind we told her she should not annoy him poor god he's doing his best don't annoy him so much
the demarren sholts also testified that quot right in front and quote of oswald marina oswald complained about oswald's inadequacy as a husband
missus oswald told another of her friends that oswald was very cold to her that they very seldom had sexual relations
and that oswald quote was not a man and quote
she also told missus payne but she was not satisfied with her sexual relations with oswald
marina oswald also ridiculed her husband's political views thereby tearing down his view of his own importance
he was very much interested in autobiographical works of outstanding statesmen of the united states to whom his wife thought he compared himself
she said he was different from other people in quote at least his imagination his fantasy which was quite unfounded
as to the fact that he was an outstanding man and quote
she said that she could always try to point out to him that he was a man like any others who were around us but he simply could not understand that 
jean de maren shilt however thought that marina oswald quotes sat things that will hurt men's pride and quote
she said that if she ever spoke to her husband the way marina oswald spoke to her husband quote we would not last long and qute
missus de morenscholt thought that oswald
whom she compared to quote a puppy dog that everybody kicked and quote had a lot of good qualities in spite of the fact that quote
nobody said anything good about him and quote
she had quote the impression that he was just pushed pushed pushed and she marina oswald was probably nagging nagging nagging ad
she thought that he might not have become involved in the assassination if people had been kinder to him
in spite of these difficulties however and in the face of the economic problems that were always with them
things apparently went quite smoothly from the time oswald returned from mexico until the week end of november sixteenth to seventeen nineteen sixty three
missus payne was planning a birthday party for one of her children on that week end and her husband michael was to be at the house
marina oswald said that she knew her husband did not like michael payne and so she asked him not to come out that week end even though he wanted to do so
she testified that she told him quote
that he shouldn't come every week that perhaps it's not convenient for ruth that the whole family be there live there and quote
she testified that he responded quote as you wish if you don't want me to come i won't and quote
ruth pain testified that she heard marina oswald tell oswald about the birthday party
on sunday november seventeenth nineteen sixty three
roof paine and marina oswald decided to call oswald at the place where he was living unbenoced to them under the name of o h lee
they asked for le oswald who was not called to the telephone because he was known by the other name
when oswald called the next day his wife became very angry about his use of the alias he said that he used it because quote
he did not want his landlady to know his real name because she might read in the paper of the fact that he had been in russia and that he had been questioned and quote
oswald also said that he did not want the f beyond to know where he lived quote because their visits were not very pleasant for him
and he thought that he loses jobs because the f b i visits the place of his employment and quote
while the facts of his defection had become known in new orleans as a result of his radio debate with bringwear
it would appear to be unlikely that his landlady in dawlis
would see anything in the newspaper about his defection unless he engaged in activities similar to those
which had led to the disclosure of his defection in new orleans
furthermore even though it appears that at times oswald was really upset by visits of the f b eye
it does not appear that he ever lost his job because of its activities although he may well not have been aware of that fact
while oswald concerned about the f be i had some basis in fact in that f b ae agent had interviewed him in the past and had renewed their interest
to some extent after his fair play for cuba committee activities had become known he exaggerated their concern for him
marina oswald thought he did so in order to emphasize his importance
for example in his letter of november ninth nineteen sixty three
to the soviet embassy in washington he asked about the entrance veses for which he and his wife had previously applied
he absolved the soviet embassy in mexico city of any blame for his difficulties there he advised the washington embassy
that the f bi i was quote not now and quote interested in his fair play for cuba committee activities but noted that the f be i quote
has visited us here in dallas texas on november one agent james p haystie
warned me that if i engaged in f p c c activities and texas the f be i will again take an interest in me and quote
neither hosty nor any other agent of the f b i spoke to oswald on any subject from august tenth nineteen sixty three
to the time of the assassination
the claimed warning was one more of oswald's fabrications
hosty had come to the pain residence on november one and five nineteen sixty three
but did not issue any such warning or suggest that marina oswald de fect from the soviet union and remain in the united states under f b i protection
as oswald went on to say in oswald's imagination quote
i and my wife strongly protested these tactics by the notorious f be i and quote
in fact his wife testified that she only said that she would prefer not to receive any more visits from the bureau
because of the quote very exciting and disturbing effect and quote they had upon her husband who was not even present at that time
the arguments he used to justify his use of the alias suggest that oswald may have come to think that the whole world was becoming involved
in an increasingly complex conspiracy against him
he may have felt he could never tell when the f be i was going to appear on the scene or who else was going to find out about his defection
and use it against him as had been done in new orleans
on the other hand the concern he expressed about the f beyind may have been just another story to support the objective he sought in his letter
those arguments however were not persuasive to marina oswald
to whom quote it was nothing terrible if people were to find out that he had been in russia and quote
she asked oswald coke
after all
when will all your foolishness come to an end all of these comedies first one thing and then another and now this fictitious name and quot
she said quote
on monday november eighteenth nineteen sixty three he called several times but after i hung up on him and didn't want to talk to him he did not call again
he then arrived on thursday november twenty oneth nineteen sixty three and qu
the events of that evening can best be appreciated through marina oswald's testimony
question did your husband give any reason for coming home on thursday
answer he said that he was lonely because he hadn't come the preceding week end and he wanted to make his peace with me
question did you say anything to him then
answer he tried to talk to me but i would not answer him and he was very upset
question
were you upset with him
answer
i was angry of course he was not angry he was upset i was angry
he tried very hard to please me
he spent quite a bit of time putting away dipers and played with the children on the street
question how did you indicate to him that you are angry with him
answer by not talking to him
question and how did he show that he was upset
he was upset over the fact that i would not answer him
he tried to start a conversation with me several times but i would not answer and he said that he didn't want me to be angry at him because this upsets him
on that day he suggested that we rent an apartment in dallis
he said that he was tired of living alone and perhaps the reason for my being so angry was the fact that we were not living together
that if i want to he would rent an apartment in dallis to morrow that he didn't want me to remain with ruth any longer but wanted me to live with him in dalice
he repeated this not once but several times but i refused and he said that once again i was preferring my friends to him and that i didn't need him
question what did you say to that
answer
i said it would be better if i remained with ruth until the holidays he would come and we would all meet together
that this was better because while he was living alone and i stayed with ruth we were spending less money and i told him to buy me a washing machine because two children
it became too difficult to wash by hand
what did he say to that
answer he said he would buy me a washing machine
question what did you say to that answer
thank you that it would be better if he bought something for himself that i would manage
and quote that night
oswald went to bed before his wife retired
she did not speak to him when she joined him there although she thought that he was still awake
the next morning he left for work before anyone else arose
for the first time
he left his wedding ring in a cup on the dresser in his room he also left one hundred seventy dollars in a wallet in one of the dresser drawers
he took with him thirteen dollars eighty seven cents and the long brown package that fraser and missus randal saw him carry
and which he was to take to the school book depository the unanswered questions
no one will ever know what passed through oswald's mind during the week before november twenty twonth nineteen sixty three
instead of returning to irving on november fifteenth for his customary week end visit he remained in dowlec at his wife's suggestion because of the birthday party
he had argued with her over the use of an alias and had not called her after that argument although he usually telephoned once or twice a day
then on thursday morning november twenty one
he asked fraser for a ride to irving that night stating falsely that he wanted to pick up some curtain rods to put in an apartment
he must have planned his attack at the very latest prior to thursday morning when he spoke to fraser
there is of course no way to determine the degree to which he was committed to his plan at that time
while there is no way to tell when he first began to think specifically of assassinating the president
it should be noted that mention of the trade marked as the expected sight of the presidential luncheon
appeared in the dallast times harold on november fifteenth nineteen sixty three
the next day that paper announced the final approval of the trade mart as the luncheon sight and stated that the motor cade quote
apparently we'll look through the downtown area probably on main street
on route from dalis love field and quote on its way to the trade mark on stemon's free way
any one who wis familiar with that area of dalice would have known that the motor cade would probably pass the texas schoolbook depository to get from main street
on to the stemons free way
that fact was made precisely clear and subsequent new stories on november nineteenth twenty and twenty two
on november fifteenth nineteen sixty three the same day that his wife told him not to come to irving oswald could have assumed
that the presidential motor cade would pass in front of his place of work
whether he thought about assassinating the president over the week end can never be known but it is reasonably certain
that over the week end he did think about his wife's request doth he not come to irving which was prompted by the birthday party being held at the pain home
oswald had a highly exaggerated sense of his own importance but he had failed at almost everything he had ever tried to do
he had great difficulty in establishing meaningful relations with other people except for his family he was completely alone
even though he had searched in the marine core in his ideal of communism in the soviet union and in his attempt to get to cuba
he had never found anything to which he felt he could really belong
after he returned from his trip to mexico where his application to go to cuba had been sharply rejected
it must have appeared to him that he was unable to command even the attention of his family
he could not keep them with him in dalis where at least he could see his children whom several witnesses testified he seemed to love
his family lived with missus payne ostensibly because oswald could not afford to keep an apartment in dowlis
but it was also at least in part because his wife did not want to live there with him
now it appeared that he was not welcome at the paint home
where he had spent every previous week end since his return from mexico and his wife was once again calling into question his judgment
this time concerning his use of an alias
the conversation on monday november eighteenth nineteen sixty three
ended when marina oswald hung up
and refused to talk to him although he may long before have decided on the course he was to follow
and may have told his wife the things he did on the evening of november twenty one
nineteen sixty three merely to disarm her and to provide a justification of sorts
both she and missus payne thought he had come home to make up
after the fight on monday
thoughts of his personal difficulties must have been at least partly on his mind when he went to irving on thursday night and told his wife that he was lonely
that he wanted to make peace with her and bring his family to dalis where they could live with him again
the commission does not believe that the relations between oswald and his wife caused him to assassinate the president
it is unlikely that the motivation was that simple
the feelings of hostility and aggression which seemed to have played such an important part in oswald's life
were part of his character long before he met his wife
and such a favorable opportunity to strike at a figure as great as the president would probably never have come to him again
oswald's behavior after the assassination throws a little light on his motives
the fact that he took so little money with him when he left irving in the morning indicates that he did not expect to get very far from dalis on his own
and suggests the possibility as did his note to his wife just prior to the attempt on general walker that he did not expect to escape at all
on the other hand he could have travelled some distance with the money he did have and he did return to his room where he obtained his revolver
he then killed patrol and tippet when that police officer apparently tried to question him after he had left his rooming house and he vigorously resisted arrest
when he was finally apprehended in the texas theatre
although it is not fully corroborated by others who were present
two officers have testified that at the time of his arrest oswald said something to the effect that quote it's all over now and quote
oswald was overbearing and arrogant throughout much of the time between his arrest and his own death
he consistently refused to admit involvement in the assassination or in the killing of patrol and tippet
while he did become enraged at at least one point in his interrogation
the testimony of the officers present indicates that he handled himself with considerable composure during his questioning
he admitted nothing that would damage him but discuss other matters quite freely
his denials under questioning which have no probitive value in view of the many readily demonstrable lies he told at that time
and in the face of the overwhelming evidence against him
which has been set forth above only served to prolong the period during which he was the centre of the attention of the entire world
many factors were undoubtedly involved in oswald's motivation for the assassination and the commission does not believe
that it can ascribe to him any one motive or group of motives
it is apparent however that oswald was moved by an overriding hostility to his environment
he does not appear to have been able to establish meaningful relationships with other people
he was perpetually discontented with the world around him
long before the assassination he expressed his hatred for american society and acted in protest against it
oswald search for what he conceived to be the perfect society was doomed from the start
he sought for himself a place in history a role as the great man who would be recognized as having been in advance of his times
his commitment to marxism and communism appears to have been another important factor in his motivation
he also had demonstrated a capacity to act decisively and without regard to the consequences when such action would further his aims of the moment
out of these and the many other factors which may have moulded the character of lee harvey oswald
there emerged a man capable of assassinating president kennedy
report of the president's commission on the assassination of president kennedy the warren commission report by
the president's commission on the assassination of president kennedy chapter eight the protection of the president part one
in the one hundred years since eighteen sixty five
four presidents of the united states have been assassinated
abraham lincoln james a garfield william mc kinley and john f kennedy
during this same period there were three other attacks on the life of a president
a president elect
and a candidate for the presidency which narrowly failed
on theodore roosevelt while campaigning in october of nineteen twelve on precident elect franklin delino roosevelt
when visiting myami on february fifteenth nineteen thirty three
and on president harry s trumann on november oneth nineteen fifty
when his temporary residence blair house was attacked by porto rican nationalists
one out of every five presidents since eighteen sixty five has been assassinated
there have been attempts on the lives of one out of every three
prompted by these dismaying statistics the commission has inquired into the problems and methods of presidential protection in effect
at the time of president kennedy's assassination
this study has led the commission to conclude that the public interest might be served by any contribution it can make to the improvement of protective arrangements
the commission has not undertaken a comprehensive examination of all facets of this subject
rather it has devoted its time and resources to those broader aspects of presidential protection
to which the events of last november called attention
in this part of its inquiry
the commission has had full access to a major study of all phases of protective activities
prepared by the secret service for the secretary of the treasury following the assassination as a result of this study
the secretary of the treasury has prepared a planning document dated august twenty seventh nineteen sixty four
which recommends additional personnel and facilities to enable the secret service to expand its protection capabilities
the secretary of the treasury submitted this planning document

on august thirty one nineteen sixty four
to the bureau of the budget for review and approval
this planning document has been made a part of the commission's published record the underlying staff and consultants reports reviewed by the commission have not
since a disclosure of such detailed information relating to protective measures might undermine present methods of protecting the president
however all information considered by the commission which pertains to the protective function as it was carried out in dalis has been published as part of this report
the protection of the president of the united states is an immensely difficult and complex task
it is unlikely that measures can be devised to eliminate entirely the multitude of diverse dangers that may arise
particularly when the president is travelling in this country or abroad
the protective task is further complicated by the reluctance of presidence to take security precautions which might interfere with the performance of their duties
or their desire to have frequent and easy access to the people
the adequacy of existing procedures can fairly be assessed only after full consideration of the difficulty of the protective assignment
with particular attention to the diverse roles which the president is expected to fill
after reviewing this aspect of the matter this chapter will set forth the commission's conclusions
regarding certain protective measures in force at the time of the dallist trip and propose recommendations for improvements
the nature of the protective assignment
the president is head of state chief executive commander in chief and leader of a political party
as the ceremonial head of the government the president must discharge a wide range of public duties not only in washington but throughout the land
in this role he appears to the american people in the words of william howard taft as quote
the personal embodiment and representative of their dignity and majesty and quote
as chief executive the president controls the exercise of the vast almost incalculable powers of the executive branch of the federal government
as commander in chief of the armed forces he must maintain ultimate authority over the development and disposition of our military power
in accordance with george washington's maxim that americans have a government quote of accommodation as well as a government of laws and quote
it is the president's right and duty to be the active leader of his party as when he seeks to be re elected or to maintain his party in power
in all of these rolls the president must go to the people
exposure of the president to public view through travel among the people of this country is a great and historic tradition of american life
desired by both the president and the public it is an indispensable means of communication between the two
more often than not presidential journeys have served more than one purpose at the same time ceremonial
administrative political
from george wash ing ton to john f kennedy
such journeys have been a normal part of the president's activities
to promote nation wide acceptance of his administration wash ing ton made grand tours that served also to excite interest in the presidency
in recent years presidential journeys have been frequent and extensive
partly because of the greater speed and comfort of travel and partly because of the greater demands made on the president
it is now possible for presidents to travel length and breadth of a land far larger than the united states
in seventeen eighty nine in less time than it took george wash ing ton to travel from new york to mount ver non
or thomas jefferson from washington to monticello
during his presidency franklin d roosevelt made almost four hundred journeys and travelled more than three hundred fifty thousand miles
since nineteen forty five roosevelt's successors have ranged the world
and their foreign journeys have come to be accepted as normal rather than extraordinary
john f kennedy's journey to texas in november nineteen sixty three was in this tradition
his friend and special assistant kenneth o'donnell who accompanied him on his last visit to dalis
stated the president's views of his responsibilities with simplicity and clarity quote
the president's views of his responsibilities as president of the united states were that he meet the people that he go out to their homes and see them
and allow them to see him and discuss if possible the views of the world as he sees it the problems of the country as he sees them
and he felt that leaving washington for the president of the united states was a most necessary not only for the people but for the president himself
that he exposed himself to the actual basic problems that were disturbing the american people
it helped him and his job here he was able to come back here with a fresh view of many things
i think he felt very strongly that the president ought to get out of washington and go meet the people on a regular basis andq
whatever their purposes presidential journeys have greatly enlarged and complicated the task of protecting the president
the secret service and the federal state and local law enforcement agencies which co operate with it
have been confronted in recent years with increasingly difficult problems created by the greater exposure of the president during his travels
and the greater diversity of the audiences he must face in a world torn by conflicting ideologies
if the soule goal were to protect the life of the president it could be accomplished with reasonable assurance despite the multiple rolls he must play
but his very position as representative of the people prevents him from effectively shielding himself from the people
he cannot and will not take the precautions of a dictator or a sovereign
under our system measures must be sought to afford security without impeding the president's performance of his many functions
the protection of the president must be thorough but inconspicuous to avoid even the suggestion of a garrison state
the rights of private individuals must not be infringed
if the protective job is well done its performance will be evident only in the unexceptional fact of its success
the men in charge of protecting the president confronted by complex problems and limited as they are in the measures they may employ
must depend upon the utmost co operation and understanding from the public and the president
the problem and the reasonable approach to its solution were ably stated in a memorandum prepared by f b i director j edgar hoover
for the president soon after the assassination
quoat
the degree of security that can be afforded the president of the united states
is dependent to a considerable extent upon the degree of contact with the general public desired by the president
absolute security is neither practical nor possible an approach to complete security would require the president
to operate in a sort of vacuum
isolated from the general public and behind impregnable barriers
his travel would be in secret his public appearances would be behind bullet proof glass a more practical approach necessitates compromise
any travel any contact with the general public involves a calculated risk on the part of the president and the men responsible for his protection
such risks can be lessened when the president recognizes the security problem
has confidence in the dedicated secret service men who are ready to lay down their lives for him
and accepts the necessary security precautions which they recommend
many presidents have been understandably impatient with the security precautions which many years of experience dictate
because these precautions reduced the president's privacy and the access to him of the people of the country
nevertheless the procedures and advice should be accepted if the president wishes to have any security
a valuation of presidential protection at the time of the assassination of president kennedy
the history of presidential protection shows growing recognition over the years that the job must be done by able dedicated
thoroughly professional personnel using the best technical equipment that can be devised
the assassination of president kennedy demands an examination of the protective measures employed to safeguard him
and an inquiry whether improvements can be made which will reduce the risk of another such tragedy
this section considers first the means used to locate potential sources of danger to the president in time to take appropriate precautions
in this connection the information available to federal agencies about lee harvey oswald
is set out and the reasons why this information was not furnished to the secret service appraised
second the adequacy of other advanced preparations for the security of the president during his visit to dalis
largely measures taken by the secret service is considered
finally the performance of those charged with the immediate responsibility of protecting the president on november twenty two is reviewed
intelligence functions relating to presidential protection at the time of the daolist trip
a basic element of presidential protection
is the identification and elimination of possible sources of danger to the president before the danger becomes actual
the secret service has attempted to perform this function through the activities of its protective research section
and requests to other agencies federal and local for useful information
the commission has concluded that at the time of the assassination
the arrangements relied upon by the secret service to perform this function were seriously deficient
adequacy of preventive intelligence operations of the secret service
the main job of the protective research section p r s
is to collect process and evaluate information about persons or groups who may be a danger to the president
in addition to this function
p r s is responsible for such tasks
as obtaining clearance of some categories of white house employees and all tradesmen who service the white house
the security processing of gifts sent to the president and technical inspections against covert listening devices
at the time of the assassination pioras was a very small group comprised of twelve specialists and three clerks
many persons call themselves to the attention of pares by attempting to visit the president
for bizarre reasons or by writing or in some other way attempting to communicate with him in a threatening or abusive manner
or with undue persistence
robert i book special agent in charge of pieres
estimated that most of the material received by his office originated in this fashion
or from the occasional investigations initiated by the secret service
while the balance was furnished to piaress by other federal agencies with primary source being the f beyind
the total volume of information received by pieares has risen steadily
in nineteen forty three
poras received approximately nine thousand items of information
in nineteen fifty three
this had increased to more than seventeen thousand items
in nineteen sixty three the total exceeded thirty two thousand items
since many items may pertain to a single case these figures do not show the case load
in the period from november nineteen sixty one
to november nineteen sixty three
pioras received items in eight thousand seven hundred nine cases
before the assassination of president kennedy
p r s expressed its interest in receiving information on suspects in very general terms for example
p r s instructed the white house mail room a source of much purest data
to refer all communications on identified existing cases and in addition
any communication quote that in any way indicates any one may have possible intention of harming the president and quote
slightly more specific criterioa were established for piaris personnel processing white house mail referred by the white house mail room
but again the standards were very general
these instructions to piares personnel appeared to be the only instance where an effort was made to reduce the criteria to writing
when requested to provide a specific statement of the standards employed by piaress in deciding what information to seek and retain
the secret service responded quote
the criteria in effect prior to november twenty twoth nineteen sixty three for determining whether to accept material for the piaress general files
were broad and flexible all material is and was desired accepted and filed if it indicated or tended to indicate
that the safety of the president is or might be in danger either at the present or in the future
there are many actions situations and incidents that may indicate such potential danger
some are specific such as threats
danger may be implied from others such as membership or activity in an organization which believes in assassination as a political weapon
all material received by piaras was separately screened
and a determination made as to whether the information might indicate possible harm to the president
if the material was evaluated
as indicating some potential danger to the president no matter how small it was indexed in the general pieress files
under the name of the individual or group of individuals to whom that material relateed and quote
the general files of piaras consist of folders on individuals card indext by name
the files are manually maintained without use of any automatic data processing technique
at the time of the assassination the active pirists general files contained approximately fifty thousand cases
accumulated over a twenty year period some of which included more than one individual
a case file was established if the information available
suggested that the subject might be a danger to the president
many of these cases were not investigated by piares
the case pile served merely as a repository for information until enough had accumulated to warrant an investigation
during the period november nineteen sixty one to november nineteen sixty three
piaras investigated thirty four newly established or reactivated cases concerning residents of texas
most of these cases involved persons who used threatening language in communications too
or about the president
an additional one hundred fifteen cases concerning texas residence
were established
but not investigated
when piaras learns of an individual whose conduct warrants scrutiny
it requests an investigation by the closest secret service field office
of which there are sixty five throughout the country
if the field office determines that the case should be subject to continuing review piaras establishes a file
which requires a check up at least every six months
this might involve a personal interview or interviews with members of the person's household
wherever possible
the secret service arranges for the family and friends of the individual
and local law enforcement officials
to advise the field office
if the subject displays signs have increased
danger
or plans to leave his home area
at the time of the assassination
they were approximately four hundred persons throughout the country
who were subject to periodic review
if piaris concludes after investigation
that an individual presents a significant danger to the life of the president
his name is placed in a
trimp
index file
which is maintained on a geographical field office basis
at the time of the assassination

the names of about one hundred persons were in this index
all of whom were included
in the group of four hundred
being reviewed regularly
piaras also maintains an album of photographs and descriptions of about twelve to fifteen individuals who are regarded as clear risks to the president
and who do not have a fixed place of residence
members of the white house detail of the secret service
have copies of this album
individuals who are regarded as dangerous to the president
and who are impenal or hospital custody are enlisted only in the general files of poares
but there is a system for the immediate notification of the secret service
by the confining institution
when a subject is released
or escapes
piores
attempts to eliminate serious risks by hospitalization or where necessary
the prosecution of persons who have committed an offence
such as threatening the president
in june nineteen sixty four
pioras had arrangements to be notified about the release
or escape
of approximately one thousand persons
in summary
at the time of the assassination
piaras had received over a twenty year period
basic information on some fifty thousand cases
it had arrangements to be notified about release from confinement
in roughly one thousand cases
it had established
periodic regular review of the status of four hundred individuals
it regarded approximately one hundred of these four hundred cases as serious risks
and
twelve to fifteen of these cases
as highly dangerous risks
members of the white house in detail
were expected to familiarize themselves with the descriptions and photographs
of the highest risk
cases
the case is subject to periodic review
and the one hundred or so cases in the higher risk category
were filed on a geographic basis
and could conveniently be reviewed
by a secret service agent preparing for a presidential trip
to a particular part of the country
these were the files re viewed by piares
on november eighth
nineteen sixty three
at the request of special agent lawson
advance agent for president kennedy's trip to dalice
the general files of piaras were not indexed by geographic location and were of little use in preparing for a presidential visit
to a specific locality
secret service requests to other agencies for intelligence in formation
were no more specific
than the broad and general instructions its own agents
and the white house mail room
the head of pioris testified that
the secret service requested other agencies to provide quote
any in all information
that they may come in contact with
that would indicate danger to the president
and quote
these requests were communicated in writing by the secret service
rather
the service depended on the personal liaison
maintained by piores
with the headquarters of the federal intelligence agencies particularly the f be i
and at the working level with personnel of the field offices of the various agencies
a service frequently participated
in the training programmes of other law enforcement agencies
and agents from other agencies
attended the regular secret service training schools
presidential protection was an important topic in these training programmes
in the absence of more specific instructions
other federal agencies interpreted the secret services in formal requests
to relate principally to over threats to harm the president
or other specific manifestations of hostility
for example
at the time of the assassination
b f the eye handbook
which is in the possession of every bureau special agent provided
quote
threats against the president of the u s
members of his immediate family the president elect and the vice president investigation of threats against the president of the united states
members of his immediate family the president elect and the vice president is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the u s secret service
any information indicating the possibility of an attempt against the person or safety of the president
members of the immediate family of the president the president elect or the vice president
must be referred immediately by the most expeditious means of communication to the nearest office of the u s secret service
advised the bureau at the same time by teletype
of the information so furnished to the secret service and the fact that it has been so disseminated
the above action should be taken without delay
in order to attempt to verify the information and no evaluation of the information should be attempted
when the threat is in the form of a written communication give a copy to local secret service and forward the original to the bureau
where it will be made available to secret service headquarters in washington
the refural of the copy to local secret service should not delay the immediate refural of the information by the fastest available means of communication
to secret service locally and quote
the state department advised the secret service of all crank and threat letter mail
or crank visitors and furnished reports concerning any assassination or attempted assassination
of a ruler or other major official anywhere in the world
the several military intelligence agencies reported crank mail and similar threats involving the president
according to special agent in charge book
the secret service had no standard procedure for the systematic review of its requests for and receipt of information from other federal agencies
the commission believes that the facilities and procedures of the protective research section of the secret service
prior to november twenty two nineteen sixty three
were inadequate
its efforts appear to have been too largely directed at the crank threat
although the service recognized
that its advance preventive measures must encompass more than these most obvious dangers
it made little effort to identify factors in the activities of an individual
or an organized group
other than specific threats which suggested a source of danger against which timely precautions could be taken
except for its special trip index file of four hundred names
none of the cases in the piaress general files was available for systematic review on a geographic basis when the president planned a particular trip
as reported in chapter two
when the special file was reviewed on november eighth
it contained the names of no persons from the entire dallis fortworth area
notwithstanding the fact that ambassador stevenson had been abused by pickets and dawis less than a month before
book explained the failure to try to identify the individuals involved in the stevenson incident after it occurred on the ground that
piares required a more direct indication of a threat to the president and that there was no such indication until the president's scheduled visit to that area became known
such an approach seriously undermines the precautionary nature of piaras work
if the presence and dowis of the stevenson pickets might have created a danger for the president on a visit to that city
piaras should have investigated and been prepared to guard against it
other agencies occasionally provided information to the secret service concerning potentially dangerous political groups
this was done in the case of the nationalist party of porto rico for example but only after members of the group had resorted to political violence
however the vague requests for information which the secret service made
to federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies were not well designed to elicit information from them
about persons other than those who were obvious threats to the president
the requests shifted the responsibility for evaluting difficult cases from the service the agency most responsible for performing that task
to the other agencies no specific guidance was provided
although the c ay a had on file requests from the treasury department for information on the counterfeiting of u s currency
and certain smuggling matters
it had no written specification of intelligence information collected by c i a abroad which was desired by the secret service
in advance of presidential trips outside the united states
report of the president's commission on the assassination of president kennedy the warren commission report by the president's commission on the assassination of president kennedy
chapter eight the protection of the president part two
information known about lee harvey oswald prior to the assassination
no information concerningly harvey oswald appeared in piares files before the president's tripped to dalis
oswald was known to other federal agencies with which the secret service maintained intelligence liaison
the fbri eye had been interested in him to some degree at least since the time of his defection in october nineteen fifty nine
it had interviewed him twice shortly after his return to the united states again a year later at his request
and was investigating him at the time of the assassination the commission has taken the testimony of bureau agents
who interviewed oswald after his return from the soviet union and prior to november twenty two nineteen sixty three
the agent who was assigned his case at the time of the assassination the director of the f b i
and the assistant to the director in charge of all investigative activities under the director and associate director in addition
the director and deputy director for plans of the s a a testified concerning that agency's limited knowledge of oswald before the assassination
finally the commission has reviewed the complete files on oswald as they existed at the time of the assassination of the department of state
the office of naval intelligence the f b i and the c y a the information known to the f beyind is summarized below
from defection to return to fortworth
the f b i opened a file on oswald in october nineteen fifty nine when news reports appeared of his defection to the soviet union
the file was opened quote
for the purpose of correlating information inasmuch as he was considered a possible security risk in the event he returned to this country and quote
oswald's defection was also the occasion for the opening of files by the department of state ce aya and the office of naval intelligence
until april nineteen sixty f beyond activity consisted of placing in oswald's file
information regarding his relations with the u s embassy in moscow and background data relating largely to his prior military service
provided by other agencies
in april nineteen sixty missus marguerite oswald and robert oswald were interviewed
in the course of a routine f  ae investigation of transfers of small sums of money from missus oswald to her son in russia
during the next two years the f bei continued to accumulate information
and kept itself informed on oswald's status by periodic reviews of state department and office of naval intelligence sfiles
in this way it learned that when oswald had arrived in the soviet union
he had attempted to renounce his you as citizenship
and applied for soviet citizenship
had described himself as a marxist had said he would give the soviet union any useful information he had acquired
as a marine braed ar technician and had displayed an arrogant and aggressive attitude at the u s embassy
it learned also that oswald had been discharged from the marine corps reserve as undesirable in august nineteen sixty
in june nineteen sixty two the bureau was advised by the department of state of oswald's plan to return to the united states
the bureau made arrangements to be advised by emigration authorities of his return
and instructed the dalis office to interview him when he got back to determine whether he had been recruited by a soviet intelligence service
oswald's file at the department of state passport office was reviewed in june nineteen sixty two
it revealed his letter of january thirtieth nineteen sixty two to secretary of the navy connolly
in which he protested his discharge and declared that he would use quote all means and quote to correct it
the file reflected the department's determination that oswald had not expatriated himself
from return to fortworth to move to new orleans
oswald was first interviewed by f b i agents john w fayne and be tom carter on june twenty sixth nineteen sixty two
aged fane reported to headquarters that oswald was impatient and arrogant
and unwilling to answer questions regarding his motive from going to the soviet union
oswald quote denied that he had ever denounced his u as citizenship and that he had ever applied for soviet citizenship specifically and quote
oswald was however willing to discuss his contacts with soviet authorities he denied having any involvement with soviet intelligence agencies
and promised to advise the f be i if he heard from them
agent fayne was not satisfied by this interview and arranged to see oswald again on august sixteenth nineteen sixty two
according to fane's contemporaneous memorandum and his present recollection
while oswald remained somewhat evasive at this interview he was not antagonistic and seemed generally to be settling down
marina oswald however recalled that her husband was upset by this interview
oswald again agreed to advise the f b i if he were approached under suspicious circumstances however he deprecated the possibility of this happening
particularly since his employment did not involve any sensitive information
having concluded that oswald was not a security risk or potentially dangerous or violent
fain determined that nothing further remained to be done at that time and recommended that the case be placed in a closed status
this is an administrative classification indicating that no further work has been scheduled
it does not preclude the agent in charge of the case from reopening it if he feels that further work should be done
from august nineteen sixty two
until march nineteen sixty three the f b i continued to accumulate information regarding oswald but engaged in no active investigation
agent fane retired from the f be i in october nineteen sixty two and the closed oswald case was not reassigned
however pursuant to a regular bureau practice of interviewing certain immigrants from iron curtained countries
fain had been assigned to see marina oswald at an appropriate time
this assignment was given to agent james p hosty junior of the dalis office upon fane's retirement
in march nineteen sixty three while attempting to locate marina oswald
aged hosty was told by missus m f tobias a former landlady of the oswalds at six o two elsbeth street in dawlis
that other tenants had complained because oswald was drinking to excess and beating his wife
this information led hosty to review oswald's file from which he learned that oswald had become a subscriber to the worker
a communist party publication
hosty decided that the lead harvey oswald case should be reopened because of the alleged personal difficulties and the contact with the worker
and his recommendation was accepted he decided however not to interview marina oswald at that time and merely determined
that the oswalds were living at two one four neelie street in dowis
on april twenty inth nineteen sixty three the f b i field office in new york
was advised that oswald was in contact with the fair play for cuba committee in new york and that he had written to the committee
stating that he had distributed its pamphlets on the streets of jalis this information did not reach agent hosty indowless until june
hosty considered the information to be quoted stale unquote by that time and did not attempt to verify oswald's reported statement
under a general bureau request to be on the alert for activities of the fair play for cuba committee
hosty had inquired earlier and found no evidence that it was functioning in the dallast area
in new orleans in the middle of may of nineteen sixty three agent hosty checked oswald's last known residence and found that he had moved
oswald was tentatively located in new orleans in june
and hosty asked the new orleans f b i office to determine oswald's address and what he was doing
the new orleans office investigated and located oswald learning his address and former place of employment on august fiveh nineteen sixty three
a confidential informant advis'd thee f the eye that oswald was not known to be engaged in communist party activities in new orleans
on june twenty fourth oswald applied in new orleans for a passport stating that he planned to depart by ship
for an extended tour of western european countries the soviet union finland and poland
the passport office of the department of state in washington had no listing for oswald requiring special treatment
and his application was approved on the following day
the f b i had not asked to be informed of any effort by oswald to obtain a passport
as it might have under existing procedures and did not know of his application
according to the bureau quote
we did not request the state department to include oswald on a list which would have resulted in advising us of any application for a passport
inasmuch as the facts relating to oswald's activities at that time did not warrant such action
our investigation of oswald had disclosed no evidence that oswald was acting under the instructions or on behalf of
any foreign government or instrumentality thereof and quote
on august ninth nineteen sixty three
oswald was arrested and jailed by the new orleans police department for disturbing the peace in connection with a street fight which broke out when he was accosted
by anticastro cubans while distributing leaflets on behalf of the fair play for cuba committee
on the next day he asked the new orleans police to arrange for him to be interviewed by the f beyond
the police called the local left the eye office and an agent john l quiggley was sent to the police station
agent quickly did not know of oswald's prior if be i record when he interviewed him
inasmuch as the police had not given oswald's name to the bureau when they called the office
quickly recalled that oswald was receptive when questioned about his general background
but less than completely truthful or co operative when interrogated about the fair play for cuba committee
quickly testified quote
when i began asking him specific details with respect to his activities in the fair play for cuba committee in new orleans as to where meetings were held
who was involved what occurred he was reticent to furnish information
reluctant and actually as far as i was concerned was completely evasive on them and quote
in quiggly's judgment
oswald quote was probably making a self serving statement in attempting to explain to me why he was distributing this literature and for no other reason
and when i got to questioning him further then he felt that his purpose had been served and he wouldn't say anything further and quote
during the interview quickly obtained background information from oswald which was inconsistent with information already in the bureau's possession
when quickly returned to his office he learned
that another bureau agent milton r neck had been conducting a background investigation of oswald at the request of agent hosty and dowbless
quickly advised knack of his interview and gave him a detailed memorandum
nac was aware of the facts known to the ef beyond and recognized oswald's false statements
for example oswald claimed that his wife's maiden naw was prossa
and that they had been married in fortworth and lived there until coming to new orleans he had told the new orleans arresting officers that he had been born in cuba
several days later the bureau received additional evidence that oswald had lied to agent quickly
on august twenty two it learned that oswald had appeared on a radio discussion programme on august twenty one
william stockey who had appeared on the radio programme with oswald told the bureau on august thirtieth
that oswald had told him that he had worked and been married in the soviet union
neither these discrepancies nor the fact that oswald had initiated the f beyond interview
was considered sufficiently unusual to necessitate another interview allan h belmont assistant to the director of the f b i
stated the bureau's reasoning in this way quote
our interest in this man at this point was to determine whether his activities constituted a threat to the internal security of the country
it was apparent that he had made a self serving statement to agent quickly it became a matter of record in our files as a part of the case
and if we determined that the course of the investigation required us to clarify or face him down with this information we would do it at the appropriate time
in other words he committed no violation of the law by telling us something that wasn't true and unless this required further investigation at that time
we would handle it in due course in accord with the whole context of the investigation and quote
on august twenty onth nineteen sixty three bureau headquarters instructed the new orleans and daless field offices
to conduct an additional investigation of oswald in view of the activities which had led to his arrest
f beyond informance in the new orleans area familiar with pro castro or communist party activity there
advised the bureau that oswald was unknown in such circles
in early september nineteen sixty three
the f be i transferred the principal responsibility for the oswald case from the dallisc office to the new orleans office
soon after on october wonth nineteen sixty three
the f be i was advised by the rental agent for the oswald' apartment in new orleans that they had moved again
according to the information received by the bureau
they had vacated their apartment and marina oswald had departed with their child in a station wagon with texas registration
on october three hosty reopened the case in dawlis to assist the new orleans office
he checked in oswald's old neighborhood and throughout the dallast fortworth area but was unable to locate oswald
the next word about oswald's location was a communication from the c a a to the f b i on october tenth
advising that an individual tentatively identified as oswald had been in touch with the soviet embassy in mexico city
in early october of nineteen sixty three
a bureau had no earlier information suggesting that oswald had left the united states
the possible contact with the soviet embassy in mexico intensified the f bi eye's interest in learning oswald's whereabouts
the f bei representative in mexico city arranged to follow up this information with the c y a and to verify oswald's entry into mexico
the s ay a message was sent also to the department of state where it was reviewed by personnel of the passport office who knew from oswald's file
that he had sought and obtained a passport on june twenty five nineteen sixty three
the department of state did not advise either the se i a or thee oth the eye of these facts
on october twenty five
the new orleans office of the f bi i learned that in september oswald had given a forwarding address of two five one five
west fifth street irving texas after receiving this information on october twenty ninth aged hosty attempted to locate oswald
on the same day hosty interviewed neighbors on fifth street and learnt that the address was that of missus ruth payne
he conducted a limited background investigation of the pains intending to interview missus payne and ask her particularly about oswald's whereabouts
having determined that missus paine was a responsible and reliable citizen host hy interviewed her on november one
the interview lasted about twenty to twenty five minutes in response to hosty's inquiries missus payne quote
readily admitted that missus marina oswald and lee oswald's two children were staying with her
she said that lee oswald was living somewhere in dowless she didn't know where she said it was in the oak cliff area but she didn't have his address
i asked her if she knew where he worked
after a moment's hesitation she told me that he worked at the texas school book depository near the downtown area of dalis
she didn't have the exact address and it is my recollection that we went to the phone book and looked it up
found it to be four one one elm street
missus paine told hosty also
that oswald was living alone an dobless because she did not want him staying at her house although she was willing to let oswald visit his wife and children
according to hosty missus payne indicated that she thought she could find out where oswald was living and would let him know
at this point in the interview hosty gave missus paine his name and office telephone number on a piece of paper
at the end of the interview marina oswald came into the room when he observed that she seemed quote quite alarmed and quote about the visit
hosty assured her through missus payne as interpreter that the f b e would not harm or harass her
on november fourth hosty telephoned the texas schoolbook depository and learned that oswald was working there
and that he had given as his address missus payne's residence in irving
hosty took the necessary steps to have the doubless office of the f be i rather than the new orleans office re established as the office with principal responsibility
on november five hosty was travelling near missus paine's home and took the occasion to stop by to ask whether she had any further information
missus payne had nothing to add to what she had already told him except that during a visit that passed weekened
oswald had said that he was a quot
trotzky eihd communist and quot
and that she found this and similar statements illogical and somewhat amusing
on this occasion hosty was at the pain residence for only a few minutes
during neither interview did hosty learn oswald's address
or telephone number and dawlis missus payne testified that she learned oswald's telephone number at the beckley street rooming house in the middle of october
shortly after oswald rented the room on october fourteenth
as discusted in chapter six she failed to report this to age and hosty
because she thought the f beyind was in possession of a great deal of information and certainly would find it very easy to learn where oswald was living
hosty did nothing further in connection with the oswald case until after the assassination
on november one nineteen sixty three
he had received a copy of the report of the new orleans office which contained agent quiggley's memorandum of the interview in the new orleans jail on august tenth
and realized immediately that oswald had given false biographic information
hosty knew that he would eventually have to investigate this
and quote
was quite interested in determining the nature of his contact with the soviet embassy in mexico city and quote
when asked what his next step would have been
hosty replied quote
well as i had previously stated i have between twenty five and forty cases assigned to me at any one time i had other matters to take care of
i had now established that lee oswald was not employed in a sensitive industry
i can now afford to wait until new orleans forwarded the necessary papers to me to show me i now had all the information
it was then my plan to interview marina oswald in detail concerning both herself and her husband's background
question
had you planned any steps beyond that point
answer no
i would have to wait until i had talked to marina to see what i could determine and from there i could make my plans
question did you take any action on this case between november five and november twenty two answer no sir
the official bureau files confirm hosty statement that from november five until the assassination no active investigation was conducted
on november eighteenth the f be i learned that oswald recently had been in communication with a soviet embassy in washington
and so advised the daliss office in the ordinary course of business
hosty received this information on the afternoon of november twenty two nineteen sixty three
non refurl of oswald to the secret service
the commission has considered carefully the question whether the f be ig
in view of all the information concerning oswald in its files should have alerted the secret service to oswald's presence in dawice
prior to president kennedy's visit
the secret service and the f be i differ
as to whether oswald fell within the category of quoth threats against the president and quote which should be referred to the service
robert i book special agent in charge of the protective research section
testified that the information available to the federal government about oswald before the assassination would if known to piaress
have made oswald a subject of concern to the secret service
book pointed to a number of characteristics besides oswald's defection the cumulative effect of which would have been to alert the secret service
to potential danger quote
i would think his continued association with the russian embassy after his return
his association with the castro groups would have been of concern to us a knowledge that he had i believe
bin court martialed for illegal possession of a gun of a hand gun in the marines
that he had owned a weapon and did a good deal of hunting or use of it perhaps in russia plus a number of items about his disposition and unreliability of character
i think all of those if we had them all together
would have added up to pointing out a pretty bad individual and i think that together had we known that he had a bantage point
would have seemed somewhat serious to us even though i must admit that none of these in themselves would be
would meet our specific criterio none of them alone but it is when you begin adding them up to some degree that you begin to get criteria that are meaning fol
and quote
mister book pointed out however that he had no reason to believe that any one federal agency had access to all this information
including the significant fact that oswald was employed in a building which overlooked the motor cayed rout
aged hosty testified that he was fully aware of the pending presidential visit to dalis
he recalled that the special agent in charge of the dallass office of the f be i j gordon shanklin
had discussed the president's visit on several occasions
including the regular by weekly conference on the morning of november twenty two
quote mister shanklin advised us among other things
that in view of the president's visit to dalice that if any one had any indication of any possibility of any acts of violence or any demonstrations against the president
or vice president to immediately notify the secret service and confirm it in writing
he had made the same statement about a week prior at another special conference which we had held
i don't recall the exact date it was about a week prior and quote
in fact hosty participated in transmitting to the secret service two pieces of information pertaining to the visit
hosty testified that he did not know until the evening of thursday november twenty one that there was to be a motor cate however
and never realized that the motor cade would pass the texas schoolbook depository building
he testified that he did not read the newspaper story describing the motor cate rout in detail since he was interested only in the fact
that the motor cade was coming up main street quote where maybe i could watch it if i had a chance and quote
even if he had recalled that oswald's place of employment was on the president's route
hosty testified that he would not have cited him to the secret service as a potential threat to the president
hosty interpreted his instructions as requiring quote
some indication that the person planned to take some action against the safety of the president of the united states or the vice president and quoth
in his opinion none of the information in the f beyond files oswald's defection his fair play for cuba activities in new orleans
his lies to agent quickly his recent visit to mexico city indicated that oswald was capable of violence
hosty's initial reaction on hearing that oswald was a suspect in the assassination was quote shock
complete surprise and quote because he had no reason to believe that oswald quote
was capable or potentially an assassin of the president of the united states and quoth
shortly after oswald was apprehended and identified hostys superior sent him to observe the interrogation of oswald
hosty parked his car in the basement of police headquarters and there met an acquaintance lieutenant jack rebel of the dallest police force
the two men disagree about the conversation which took place between them
they agree that hosty told revel
that the f b i had known about oswald and in particular of his presence in jalice and his employment at the texas school book depository building
revel testified that hosty said also that the f b i had information that oswald was quote capable of committing this assassination and quote
according to revel hosty indicated that he was going to tell this to lieutenant wells of the homicide and robbery bureau
revel promptly made a memorandum of this conversation in which the quoted statement appears
his secretary testified that she prepared such a report for him that afternoon and chief of police jesse e curry
and district attorney henry m wade both testified that they saw it later that day
hosty has unequivocally denied first by affidavit and then in his testimony before the commission
that he ever said that oswald was capable of violence or that he had any information suggesting this
the only witness to the conversation was dalis police detective v j bryan who was accompanying revel
bryan did not hear host hy make any statement concerning oswald's capacity to be an assassin
report of the president's commission on the assassination of president kennedy the warren commission report by the president's commission on the assassination of president kennedy
chapter eight the protection of the president part three
hosty's interpretation of the prevailing f be a instructions on refurals to the secret service was defended before the commission by his superiors
after summarising the bureau's investigative interest in oswald prior to the assassination j edgar hoover concluded that quote
there was nothing up to the time of the assassination that gave any indication that this man was a dangerous character who might do harm to the president
or to the vice president and quote
director hoover emphasized that the first indication of oswald's capacity for violence
was his attempt on general walker's life which did not become known to the f bei until after the assassination
both director hoover and his assistant allan h belmont
stressed also the decision by the department of state that oswald should be permitted to return to the united states
neither believed that the bureau investigation of him up to november twenty two revealed any information which would have justified refeural to the secret service
according to belmont when oswald returned from the soviet union quote
he indicated that he had learned his lesson
was disenchanted with russia and had a renewed concept i am paraphrasing a renewed concept of the american free society
we talked to him twice
he likewise indicated he was disenchanted with russia
we satisfied ourselves that we had met our requirement namely to find out whether he had been recruited by soviet intelligence the case was closed
we again exhibited interest on the basis of these contacts with the worker fair play for cuba committee which are relatively inconsequential
his activities for the fair play for cuba committee in new orleans we knew were not of real consequences he was not connected with any organized activity there
the interview with him in jail is not significant from the standpoint of whether he had a propensity for violence
question
this is the quiggly interview you are talking about
answer yes it was a self serving interview the visits with the soviet embassy were evidently for the purpose of securing a viza
and he had told us during one of the interviews that he would probably take his wife back to soviet russia sometime in the future
he had come back to dais hosty had established that he had a job he was working
and had told missus payne that when he got the money he was going to take an apartment when the baby was old enough he was going to take an apartment and the family would live together
he gave evidence of settling down
nowhere during the course of this investigation or the information that came to us from other agencies was there any indication of a potential for violence on his part
consequently there was no basis for hosty to go to secret service and advise them of oswald's presence
and quote
as reflected in this testimony
the officials of the f b i believed that there was no data in its files which gave warning that oswald was a source of danger to president kennedy
while he had expressed hostility at times towards the state department the marine corps and the f bea as agents of the government
so far as the act beyond you he had not shown any potential for violence
prior to november twenty two nineteen sixty three
no law enforcement agency had any information to connect oswald with the attempted shooting of general walker
it was againsto this background and consistent with the criteria followed by the f be i prior to november twenty two
that agents of the f be i indowis did not consider oswald's presence in the texas schoolbook depository building
overlooking the motor cave rout
as a source of danger to the president
and did not inform the secret service of his employment
in the depository building
the commission believes however
that the f b i took an unduly restrictive view of its responsibilities in preventive intelligence work prior to the assassination
the commission appreciates the large volume of cases handled by the f beyind
six hundred thirty six thousand three hundred seventy one investigated matters during fiscal year nineteen sixty three
there were no secret service criteria
which specifically required the refurl of oswald's case to the secret service
nor was there any requirement to report the names of defectors however
there was much material in the hands of the f b i about oswald
the knowledge of his defection his arrogance and hostility to the united states
his pro castro tendencies his lies when interrogated by the f be i
his stripped to mexico where he was in contact with soviet authorities
his presence in the school book depository job and its location along the route of the motor caye
all this does seem to amount to enough to have induced an alert agency such as the f b i
possessed of this information to list oswald as a potential threat
to the safety of the president
this conclusion may be tinged with hind sight but
it stated primarily to direct the thought of those responsible for the future safety of our presidents to the need for a more imaginative
and less narrow interpretation of their responsibilities
it is the conclusion of the commission that even in the absence of secret service criteria
which specifically required the refural of such a case as oswald
to the secret service
a moral alert and carefully considered treatment of the oswald case by the bureau might have brought about such a ruffarol
had such a review been undertaken by the f b eye
there might conceivably have been additional investigation of the oswald case between november five and november twenty two
agent host he testified
that several matters brought to his attention in late october and early november including the visit to the soviet embassy in mexico city
required further attention
under proper procedures knowledge of the pending presidential visit might have prompted hosty
to have made more vigorous efforts to locate oswald's rooming house address in dawlis
and to interview him
regarding these unresolved matters
the formal f bia instructions to its agents outlining the information to be referred to the secret service were too narrow at the time of the assassination
while the secret service bears the principal responsibility for this failure
the f beig instructions did not reflect fully
the secret services need for information regarding potential threats
the handbook referred thus to quote the possibility of an attempt against the person or safety of the president and quote
it is clear from hosty's testimony that this was construed at least by him
as requiring evidence of a plan or conspiracy to injure the president
efforts made by the bureau since the assassination on the other hand
reflect keen awareness of the necessity of communicating a much wider range of intelligence information to the service
most important notwithstanding that both agencies have professed to the commission that the liaison between them was close and fully sufficient
the commission does not believe that the liaison between the f beind and the secret service prior to the assassination
was as effective as it should have been
he if beyond manual of instructions provided
quote
liaison with other government agencies
to insure adequate and effective liaison arrangements
each as a ce should specifically designate an agent or agents to be responsible for developing
and maintaining liaison with other federal agencies
this liaison should take into consideration
f beyind agency community of interests location of agency headquarters and the responsiveness of agency representatives
in each instance liaison contact should be developed
to include a close friendly relationship
mutual understanding of f b i and agency jurisdictions and an indicated willingness by the agency representative
to co ordinate activities and to discuss problems of mutual interest
each field office should determine those federal agencies which are represented locally and with which liaison should be conducted
and quoth
the testimony reveals that liaison responsibilities in connection with the president's visit
were discussed twice officially by the special agent in charge of the f b a office in dalis
as disgusted chapter two
some limited information was made available to the secret service but there was no fully adequate liaison between the two agencies
indeed
the commission believes that the liaison between all federal agencies responsible for presidential protection should be improved
other protective measures and aspects of secret service performance
the president's tripped to dalice called into play many standard operating procedures of the secret service in addition to its preventive intelligence operations
examination of these procedures shows that in most respects they were well conceived
and ably executed by the personnel of the service
against the background of the critical events of november twenty two however
certain shortcomings and lapses from the high standards which the commission believes should prevail in the field of presidential protection are evident
advance preparations
the advance preparations endoweus by agent winston g lawson of the white house detail have been described
in chapter two
with the assistance of agent in charge sorrels of the dallest field office of the secret service
lawson was responsible for working out a great many arrangements for the president's trip
this service prefers to have two agents perform advance preparations
in the case of dalis because president kennedy had scheduled visits to five texas cities
and had also scheduled visits to other parts of the country immediately before the texas trip
there were not enough men available to permit two agents to be assigned to all the advance work
agent lawson did the advance work alone from november thirteenth to november eighteenth when he was joined by agent david b grant
who had just completed advance work on the president's trip to tampa
the commission concludes that the most significant advance arrangements for the president's trip
were soundly planned
in particular
the commission believes that the motor caye rout selected by agent laws sent upon the advice of agent an charged sorrows
and with the concurrence of the dallist police was entirely appropriate in view of the known desires of the president
there were far safer routes via free ways directly to the trade mart
but these routes would not have been in accordance with the white house staff instructions given the secret service for a desirable motor cade rout
much of lowson's time was taken with establishing adequate security over the motor cate route and at the two places where the president would stop
love field and the trade mark
by these secret service agents with the co operation of the dalliss police and other local law enforcement agents
were carefully executed
since the president was to be at the trade marked longer than at any other location endowus and in view of the security hazards presented by the building
the secret service correctly gave particular attention in the advance preparations to those arrangements
the commission also regards the security arrangements worked out by losson and sorrels at love field as entirely adequate
the commission believes however
that the secret service has inadequately defined the responsibilities of its advanced agents who have been given broad discretion
to determine what matters require attention in making advance preparations and to decide what action to take
agent lawson was not given written instructions concerning the taolist trip or advice about any peculiar problems which it might involve
all instructions from higher authority were communicated to him orally
he did not have a check list of the tasks he was expected to accomplish either by his own efforts or with the co operation of local authorities
the only systematic supervision of the activities of the advance agent
has been that provided by a requirement that he file interim and final reports on each advance assignment
the interim report must be in the hands of the agent supervising the protective group travelling with the president
long enough before his departure to apprize him of any particular problems encountered and the responsive action taken
agent lawson's interim report was received by agent kellermen on november twenty the day before departure
on the texas trip
the secret service has advised the commission
that no unusual precautions were taken for the dallist trip
and that quote
the precautions taken for the president's trip
were the usual safeguards employed on trips of this kind in the united states during the previous year and quoth
special agent and charge sorrels testified that the advance preparations followed on this occasion were quote pretty much the same and quote
as those followed in nineteen thirty six during a trip to dawlis by president roosevelt
which was sorrel's first important assignment in connection with presidential work
in view of the constant change in the nature of threats to the president and the diversity of the dangers which may arise in the various cities within the united states
the commission believes that standard procedures in use for many years and applied in all parts of the country may not be sufficient
there is for example
no secret service arrangement for evaluating before a trip
particular difficulties that might be anticipated
which would bring to bear the judgment and experience of members of the white house detail other than the advance agent
constant revaluation of procedures with attention to special problems and the development of instructions specific to particular trips
would be a desirable innovation
liaison with local law enforcement authorities
in the description of the important aspects of the advance preparations
there have been references to the numerous discussions between secret service representatives and the daolist police department
the whole hearted support of these local authorities was indispensable to the service
in carrying out its duties
the service had twenty eight agents participating in the daoless visit
agent lawson's advance planning called for the deployment of almost six hundred members of the dallist police department
fire department
county sheriff's department and the texas department of public safety
despite this dependence on local authorities
which would be substantially the same on a visit by the president to any large city
the secret service did not at the time of the assassination have any established procedure governing its relationships with them
it had no prepared check list of matters to be covered with local police on such visits to metropolitan areas
and no written description of the role the local police were expected to perform
discussions with the dabless authorities and requests made of them were entirely informal
the commission believes
that a more formal statement of assigned responsibilities
supplemented in each case to reflect the peculiar conditions of each presidential trip
is essential
this would help to eliminate varying interpretations of secret service instructions by different local law enforcement representatives for example
while the secret service representatives endowes
asked the police to station guards at each overpat to keep quote
unauthorized personnel and quote off this term was not defined
at some overpasses all persons were excluded
while on the overpat overlooking the assassination scene
railroad and yard terminal workmen were permitted to remain under police supervision
as disgust in chapter three
assistant chief bachelor of the dallis police
noted the absence of any formal statement by the secret service
of specific work assigned to the police
and suggested the desirability of such a statement
agent loss had agreed that such a procedure would assist him and other agents in fulfilling their responsibilities as advance agents
check of buildings along route of motor cade
agent lawson did not arrange for a prior inspection of buildings along the motor cade rout
either by police or by custodians of the buildings since it was not the usual practice of the secret service to do so
the chief of the service has provided the commission
a detailed explanation of this policy
quite
except for inauguration
or other parades involving foreign dignitaries accompanied by the president in washington
it has not been the practice of the secret service
to make surveys or checks of buildings along the route
of a presidential motor cade
for the inauguration and certain other parades in washington where the traditional route is known to the public
long in advance of the event
buildings along the route can be checked by teams of law enforcement officers
and armed guards are posted along the route as appropriate
but on out of town trips where the route is decided on and made public only a few days in advance
buildings are not checked either by secret service agents
or by any other law enforcement officers
at the request of the secret service
with the number of men available to the secret service and the time available surveys of hundreds of buildings and thousands of windows is not practical
indowus
the rats selected necessarily involved passing through the principal down town section between tall buildings
while certain streets thought to be too narrow could be avoided and other choices made
it was not practical to select a route
where the president could not be seen from roofs or windows of buildings
at the two places in dawlus where the president would remain for a period of time
love field
and the trade mark
arrangements were made for building and roof security
by posting police officers were appropriate
similar arrangements for a motor cate of ten miles including many blocks of tall commercial buildings is not practical
nor is it practical to prevent people from entering such buildings or to limit axcess in every building to those employed or having business there
even if it were possible with a vastly larger force of security officers to do so many observers have felt
that such a procedure would not be consistent
with the nature and purpose of the motor caid
to let the people see their president
and to welcome him to their city
in accordance with its regular procedures no survey or other check was made by the secret service or by any other law enforcement agency at its request
of the texas schoolbook depository building
or those employed there
prior to the time the president was shot
and quote
this justification of the secret services standing policy is not persuasive
the danger from a concealed sniper on the dallist trip
was of concern to those who had considered the problem
president kennedy himself had mentioned it that morning
as had aged sorrows when he and agent lawson were fixing the motor cayed rout
admittedly
protective measures cannot ordinarily be taken with regard to all buildings along a motor cayed rout
levels of risk can be determined however as has been confirmed by building surveys made since the assassination
for the department of the treasury
an attempt to cover only the most obvious points of possible ambush along the route in dawlis might well have included the texas schoolbook depository building
instead of such advanced precautions the secret service depended in part on the efforts of local law enforcement personnel stationed along the route
in addition
secret service agents riding in the motor cade were trained to scan buildings as part of their general observation of the crowd of spectators
these substitute measures were of limited value
agent lawson was unable to state whether he had actually instructed
the daloless police to scan windows of buildings lining the motor cade rout although it was his usual practice to do so
if such instructions were in fact given they were not effectively carried out
television films taken of parts of the motor cade by a dallos television station
showed the foot patrolman facing the passing motor cad
and not the adjacent crowds and buildings as the procession passed
three officers from the dalliss police department were assigned to the intersection of elm and houston
during the morning of november twenty two prior to the motor cate
all received their instructions early in the morning
from captain p w lawrence of the traffic division
according to captain lawrence
quote
i then told the officers that their primary duty was traffic in crowd control
and that they should be alert for any persons who might attempt to throw anything
and although it was not a violation of the law
to carry a placard
that they were not to tolerate any actions such as the stevenson incident
and arrest any person who might attempt to throw anything or try to get at the president and his party
paying particular attention to the crowd for any unusual activity
i stressed the fact that this was our president and he should be shown every respect to do his position and that it was our duty
to see that this was done
and quote
captain lawrence was not instructed to have his men watch buildings along the motor cade rout
and did not mention the observation of buildings to them
the three officers confirm
that their primary concern was crowd and traffic control
and that they had no opportunity to scan the windows of the depository or any other building in the vicinity of elm and houston
when the motor cade was passing
they had however
occasionally observed the windows of buildings in the area before the motor cate arrived in accordance with their own understanding of their function
as the motor cade approached elm street
there were several secret service agents in it
who shared the responsibility of scanning the windows of nearby buildings
agent sorrels riding in the lead car
did observe the texas school book depository building as he passed by
at least
for a sufficient number of seconds to gain a quote general impression and quote
of the lack of any unusual activity
he was handicapped however by the fact that he was riding in a closed car
whose roof at times obscured his view
lawson
also in the lead car
did not scan any buildings since an important part of his job
was to look backward at the president's car
lost and stated that he quote was looking back a good deal of the time
watching his car
watching the sides watching the crowds giving advice
or asking advice from the chief
and also looking ahead to the known hazards like over passes
under passes railroads et ce and quothe
agent roy h kellerman riding in the front seat of the presidential car
stated that he scanned the depository building but not sufficiently to be alerted by anything in the windows or on the roof
the agents in the follow up car also were expected to scan adjacent buildings
however
the commission does not believe that agents stationed in a car behind the presidential car
who must concentrate primarily on the possibility of threats from crowds along the route
provide a significant safeguard
against dangers in nearby buildings
conduct of secret service agents in fortworth on november twenty two
in the early morning hours on november twenty twioth nineteen sixty three
in fortworth there occurred a breach of discipline by some members of the secret service who were officially travelling with the president
after the president had retired at his hotel
nine agents who were off duty went to the near by fortworth press club at midnight or slightly thereafter expecting to obtain food
they had little opportunity to eat during the day no food was available at the press club
all of the agents stayed for a drink of beer or in several cases a mixed drink
according to their affidavits the drinking in no case amounted to more than three glasses of beer or one and a half mixed drinks
and others who were present say that no agent was inebriated or acted improperly
the statements of the agents involved are supported by statements of members of the fortworth press who accompanied or observed them
and by a secret service investigation
according to their statements the agents remained at the press club for periods varying from thirty minutes to an hour and a half
and the last agent left the press club by two a m
two of the nine agents returned to their rooms the seven others proceeded to an establishment called the cellar coffee house
described by some as a beat neck place and by its manager as quote a unique show place with continuous light entertainment all night
serving only coffee fruit juices and no hard liquors or beer and quot
there is no indication than any of the agents who visited the cellar coffee house had any intoxicating drink at that establishment
most of the agents were there from about one thirty or one forty five a m to about two forty five or three a m
one agent was there from too until five a m
the lobby of the hotel and the areas adjacent to the quarters of the president were guarded during the night
by members of the midnight to eight a m shift of the white house detail
these agents were each relieved for a half hour break during the night
three members of this shift separately took this opportunity to visit the cellar coffee house
only one stayed as long as a half hour and none had any beverage there
chief raly testified that agents on duty in such a situation usually stay within the building during their relief
but that their visits to the cellar work quote
neither consistent nor inconsistent and quote with their duty
each of the agents who visited the press club or the cellar coffee house apart from the three members of the midnight shift
had duty assignments beginning no later than eight a m that morning
president kennedy was scheduled to speak across the street from his hotel in fortworth at eight thirty a m
and then at a breakfast after which the enterage would proceed to dalis
in dowis one of the nine agents was assigned to assist in security measures at love field and four had protective assignments at the trade mark
the remaining four had key responsibilities as members of the complement of the follow up car in the motor cade
three of these agents occupied positions on the running boards of the car and the fourth was seated in the car
the supervisor of each of the off duty agents who visited the press club or the cellar coffee house
advised in the course of the secret service investigation of these events that each agent reported for duty on time
with full possession of his mental and physical capabilities and entirely ready for the performance of his assigned duties chief rally testified that
as a result of the investigation he ordered he was satisfied that each of the agents performed his duties in an entirely satisfactory manner
and that their conduct the night before did not impede their actions on duty
or in the slightest way prevent them from taking any action that might have averted the tragedy
however chief raligh did not condone the action of the off duty agents particularly since it violated a regulation of the secret service
which provides quote
liquor use of
a employees are strictly enjoined to refrain from the use of intoxicating liquor
during the hours they are officially employed at their post of duty or when they may reasonably expect that they may be called upon to perform an official duty
during entire periods of travel status
the special agent is officially employed and should not use liquor until the completion of all his official duties for the day
after which time a very moderate use of liquor will not be considered a violation
however all members of the white house detail
and special agents co operating with them on presidential and similar protective assignments are considered to be subject to call for official duty
at any time while in travel status
therefore the use of intoxicating liquor of any kind including beer and wine by members of the white house detail
and special agents co operating with them or by special agents on similar assignments
while they are in a travel status is prohibited
and quoth
the regulations provide further that quote violation or slight disregard and quote of these provisions quote
will be caused for removal from the service and quote
chief rally testified
that under ordinary circumstances he would have taken disciplinary action against those agents who had been drinking in clear violation of the regulation
however he felt that any disciplinary action might have given rise
to an inference that the violation of the regulation had contributed to the tragic events of november twenty two
since he was convinced that this was not the case he believed that it would be unfair to the agents and their families to take explicit disciplinary measures
he felt that each agent recognized the seriousness of the infraction and that there was no danger of a repetition
the commission recognizes that the responsibilities of members of the white house detail of the secret service are arduous
they work long hard hours under very great strain and must travel frequently
it might seem harsh to circumscribe their opportunities for relaxation
yet their role of protecting the president is so important to the well being of the country
that it is reasonable to expect them to meet very high standards of personal conduct
so that nothing can interfere with their bringing to their task the finest qualities and maximum resources of mind and body
this is the salutary goal to which the secret service regulation is directed
when it absolutely forbids drinking by any agent accompanying the president on a trip
nor is this goal served when agents remain out until early morning hours
and lose the opportunity to get a reasonable amount of sleep
it is conceivable that those men who had little sleep and who had consumed alcoholic beverages even in limited quantities
might have been more alert in the dallest motor cade if they had retired promptly in forthworth
however there is no evidence that these men failed to take any action endowless within their power that would have averted the tragedy as will be seen
report of the president's commission on the assassination of president kennedy
the warren commission report by the president's commission on the assassination of president kennedy
chapter eight the protection of the president part four
the motor cade in dowlis
rigorous security precautions had been arranged at love field with the local law enforcement authorities by agents sorrewls and losson
these precautions included reserving a ceremonial area for the presidential party
stationing police on the roof tops of all buildings overlooking the reception area
and detailing police in civilian clothes to be scattered throughout the sizable crowd
when president and missus kennedy shook hands with members of the public along the fences surrounding the reception area they were closely guarded by secret service agents
who responded to the unplanned event with dispatch
as described in chapter two the president directed that his car stop on two occasions during the motor caide so that he could greet members of the public
at these stops agents from the presidential follow up car stood between the president and the public
and on one occasion agent kellerman left the front seat of the president's car to take a similar position
the commission regards such impromptu stops as presenting an unnecessary danger
but finds that the secret service agents did all that could have been done to take protective measures
the presidential limousine
the limousine used by president kennedy and dalice was a convertible with a detachable rigid plastic bubble top
which was neither bullet proof nor bullet resistant
the last presidential vehicle with any protection against small arms fire left the white house in nineteen fifty three
it was not then replaced because the state of the art did not permit the development of a bullet proof top of sufficiently light weight
to permit its removal on those occasions when the president wished to ride in an open car
the secret service believed that it was very doubtful that any president would ride regularly in a vehicle with a fixed top even though transparent
since the assassination the secret service with the assistance of other federal agencies and of private industry
has developed a vehicle for the better protection of the president
access to passenger compartment of presidential car
on occasion the secret service has been permitted to have an agent riding in the passenger compartment with the president
presidents have made it clear however that they did not favour this or any other arrangement which interferes with the privacy of the president and his guests
the secret service has therefore suggested this practice only on extraordinary occasions
without attempting to prescribe or recommend specific measures which should be employed for the future protection of presidents
the commission does believe that there are aspects of the protective measures employed in the motor cated dalis which deserves special comment
the presidential vehicle in use and dallis described in chapter two
had no special design or equipment which would have permitted the secret service agent riding in the driver's compartment
to move into the passenger's section without hindrance or delay had the vehicle been so designed it is possible that an agent riding in the front seat
could have reached the president in time to protect him from the second and fatal shot to hit the president
however such access to the president was interfered with both by the metal bar some fifteen inches above the back of the front seat
and by the passengers in the jump seats
in contrast the vice presidential vehicle although not specially designed for that purpose
had no passenger in a jump seat between agent young blood and vice president johnson to interfere with agent young blood's ability
to take a protective position in the passenger compartment before the third shot was fired
the assassination suggests that it would have been of prime importance
in the protection of the president if the presidential car permitted immediate access to the president by a secret service agent at the first sign of danger
at that time the agents on the framing boards of the follow up car were expected to perform such a function
however these agents could not reach the president's car when it was travelling and an appreciable rate of speed
even if the car is travelling more slowly the delay involved in reaching the president may be crucial
it is clear that at the time of the shots and dawlis aged clinton jay hill leaped to the president's rescue as quickly as humanly possible
even so analysis of the motion picture films taken by amateur photographer's suppruder
reveals that hale first placed his hand on the presidential car
at frame three forty three thirty frames
and therefore approximately one point six seconds after the president was shot in the head
about three point seven seconds after the president received this wound
hill had both feet on the car and was climbing aboard to assist president and missus kennedy
planning for motor cade contingencies
in response to inquiry by the commission regarding the instructions to agents in a motor cade
of emergency procedures to be taken in a contingency such as that which actually occurred the secret service responded quote
the secret service has consistently followed two general principles in emergencies involving the president
all agents are so instructed
the first duty of the agents and the motor cade is to attempt to cover the president as closely as possible and practicable
and to shield him by attempting to place themselves between the president and any source of danger
secondly
agents are instructed to remove the president as quickly as possible from known or impending danger
agents are instructed that it is not their responsibility to investigate or evaluaite
a present danger
but to consider any untoward circumstances as serious and to afford the president maximum protection at all times
no responsibility rests upon those agents near the president for the identification or arrest of any assassin or an attacker
their primary responsibility is to stay with and protect the president
beyond these two principles the secret service believes a detailed contingency or emergency plan is not feasible
because the variations possible preclude effective planning
a number of steps are taken however to permit appropriate steps to be taken in an emergency
for instance
the lead car always is manned by secret service agents familiar with the area
and with local law enforcement officials
the radio net in use an motor cades is elaborate and permits a number of different means of communication with various local points
a doctor is in the motor cane
this basic approach to the problem of planning for emergencies is sound
any effort to prepare detailed contingency plants might well have the undesirable effect of inhibiting quick and imaginative responses
if the advance preparation is thorough and the protective devices and techniques employed oure sound
those in command should be able to direct the response appropriate to the emergency the commission finds that the secret service agents in the motor cade
who were immediately responsible for the president's safety reacted promptly at the time the shots were fired
their actions demonstrate that the president and the nation can expect courage and devotion to duty from the agents of the secret service
recommendations
the commission's review of the provisions for presidential protection at the time of president kennedy's triptodalis demonstrates the need for substantial improvements
since the assassination the secret service on the department of the treasury
have properly taken the initiative in re examining major aspects of presidential protection
many changes have already been made and others are contemplated some of them in response to the commission's questions and informal suggestions
assassination of federal crime
there was no federal criminal jurisdiction over the assassination of president kennedy
had there been reason to believe that the assassination was the result of a conspiracy federal jurisdiction could have been asserted
it has long been a federal crime to conspire to injure any federal officer on account of or while he is engaged in the lawful discharge of the duties of his office
murderer of the president has never been covered by federal law however so that once it became reasonably clear that the killing was the act of a single person
the state of texas had exclusive jurisdiction
it is anomalous that congress has legislated in other ways touching upon the safety of the chief executive or other federal officers
without making an attack on the president a crime
threatening harm to the president is a federal offence
as his advocacy of the overthrow of the government by the assassination of any of its officers
the murder of federal judges u s attorneys and marshals and the number of others specifically designated
federal law enforcement officers is a federal crime
equally anomalous or statutory provisions which specifically authorized the secret service to protect the president
without authorizing it to arrest any one who harms him
the same provisions authorized the service to arrest without warrant
persons committing certain offences including counterfeiting and certain frauds involving federal checks or securities
the commission agrees with the secret service that it should be authorized to make arrests without warrant
for all offences within its jurisdiction as are f biae agents and federal marshals
there have been a number of efforts to make assassination of federal crime particularly after the assassination of president mc kinley
and the attempt on the life of president elect franklin dy roosevelt
in nineteen o two bills passed both houses of congress but failed of enactment when the senate refused to accept the conference report
a number of bills were introduced immediately following the assassination of president kennedy
the commission recommends to the congress that it adopt legislation which would
punished the murder or manslaughter of attempt or conspiracy to murder kidnapping of and assault upon
the president vice president or other officer next in the order of succession to the office of president the president elect and the vice president elect
whether or not the act is committed while a victim is in the performance of his official duties or on account of such performance
such a statute would cover the president and vice president or in the absence of a vice president the person next in order of succession
during the period between election and inauguration the president elect and vice president elect would also be covered
restricting the coverage in this way would avoid unnecessary controversy over the inclusion or exclusion of other officials who are in the order of succession
or who hold important governmental posts
in addition the restriction would probably eliminate a need for the requirement which has been urged as necessary for the exercise of federal power
that the hostile act occur while the victim is engaged in or because of the performance of official duties
the governmental consequences of assassination of one of the specified officials give the united states ample power to act for its own protection
the activities of the victim at the time an assassination occurs and the motive for the assassination
bear no relationship to the injury to the united states which follows from the act
this point was ably made in the nineteen o two debate by senator george f hor the sponsor of the senate bill quote
what this bill means to punish is the crime of interruption of the government of the united states and the destruction of its security by striking down the life
of the person who is actually in the exercise of the executive power or
of such persons as have been constitutionally and lawfully provided to succeed thereto in case of vacancy it is important to this country
that the interruption shall not take place for an hour and quote
enactment of this statute would mean that the investigation of any of the acts covered and of the possibility of a further attempt
would be conducted by federal law enforcement officials in particular the f b i with the assistance of the secret service
at present federal agencies participate only upon the sufferance of the local authorities
while the police work of the dallest authorities in the early identification and apprehension of oswald was both efficient and prompt
f be i director j edgar hoover who strongly supports such legislation testified that the absence of clear federal jurisdiction
over the assassination of president kennedy
led to embarrassment and confusion in the subsequent investigation by federal and local authorities
in addition the proposed legislation will ensure
that any suspects who are arrested will be federal prisoners subject to federal protection from vigilanty justice and other threats
committee of cabinet officers as our government has become more complex
agencies other than the secret service have become involved in phases of the overall problem of protecting our national leaders
the f be i is the major domestic investigating agency of the united states
while the s  a has the primary responsibility for collecting intelligence overseas to supplement information acquired by the department of state
the secret service must rely in large part
the commission believes that it is necessary to improve the co operation among these agencies
and to emphasize that the task of presidential protection is one of broad national concern
the commission suggests that consideration might be given to assigning to a cabinet level committee or the national security council
which is responsible for advising the president respecting the co ordination
of departmental policies relating to the national security the responsibility to review and oversee the protective activities of the secret service
and the other federal agencies that assist in safeguarding the president the committee should include the secretary of the treasury and the attorney general
and if the council is used arrangements should be made for the attendance of the secretary of the treasury
and the attorney general at any meetings which are concerned with presidential protection
the council already includes in addition to the president and vice president the secretaries of state and defence and has a competent staff
the foremost assignment of the committee would be to ensure that the maximum resources of the federal government are fully engaged in the job of protecting the president
by defining responsibilities clearly and overseeing their execution
major needs of personnel or other resources might be met more easily on its recommendation than they have been in the past
the committee would be able to provide guidance in defining the general nature of domestic and foreign dangers to presidential security
as improvements are recommended for the advance detection of potential threats to the president it could act as a final review board
the expert assistance and resources which it could draw upon would be particularly desirable in this complex and sensitive area
this arrangement would provide a continuing high level contact for agencies that may wish to consult respecting particular protective measures
for various reasons the secret service has functioned largely as an informal part of the white house staff with the result
that it has been unable as a practical matter to exercise sufficient influence over the security precautions which surround presidential activities
a cabinet level committee which is actively concerned with these problems would be able to discuss these matters more effectively with the president
responsibilities for presidential protection
the assignment of the responsibility of protecting the president to an agency of the department of the treasury was largely an historical accident
the secret service was organized as a division of the department of the treasury in eighteen sixty five to deal with counterfeiting
in eighteen ninety four
while investigating a plot to assassinate president cleveland the service assigned a small protective detail of agents to the white house
secret service men accompanied the president and his family to their vacation home in massachusetts
and special details protected him in washington on trips and at special functions
these informal and part time arrangements led to more systematic protection in nineteen o two after the assassination of president mc kinley
the secret service than the only federal investigative agency assumed whole time responsibility for the safety of the president
since that time the secret service has had and exercised responsibility for the physical protection of the president
and also for the preventive investigation of potential threats against the president
although the secret service has had the primary responsibility for the protection of the president
the f be e which was established within the department of justice in nineteen o eight has had in recent years an increasingly important role to play
in the appropriations of the f be i there has recurred annually and item for the quote protection of the person of the president of the united states and quote
which first appeared in the appropriation of the department of justice in nineteen ten under the heading quote miscellaneous objects and quote
although the f b eye is not charged with the physical protection of the president it does have an assignment as do other government agencies
in the field of preventive investigation in regard to the president's security
as disgussed above the bureau has attempted to meet its responsibilities in this field by spelling out in its handbook
the procedures which its agents are to follow in connection with information received quote
indicating the possibility of an attempt against the person or safety of the president and quote or other protected persons
with two federal agencies operating in the same general field of preventive investigation
questions inevitably arise as to the scope of each agency's authority and responsibility
as the testimony of j edgar hoover and other bureau officials revealed the f be e did not believe that its directive required the bureau
to notify the secret service of the substantial information about lee harvey oswald which the f b in had accumulated
before the president reached dalis
on the other hand the secret service had no knowledge whatever of oswald his background or his employment at the book depository
and robert i book who was in charge of the protective research section of the secret service believed that the accumulation of the facts known to the f be i
should have constituted a sufficient basis to warn the secret service of the oswald risk
the commission believes that both the f be i and the secret service have too narrowly construed their respective responsibilities
the commission has the impression
that too much emphasis is placed by both on the investigation of specific threats by individuals and not enough on dangers from other sources
in addition the commission has concluded that the secret service particularly tends to be the passive recipient of information
regarding such threats and that its protective research section is not adequately staffed or equipped
to conduct the wider investigative work that is required to day for the security of the president
during the period the commission was giving thought to this situation
the commission received a number of proposals designed to improve current arrangements for protecting the president
these proposals included suggestions to locate exclusive responsibility for all phases of the work
in one or another government agency to clarify the division of authority between the agencies involved and to retain the existing system
but expand both the scope and the operations of the existing agencies particularly those of the secret service and the f beind
it has been pointed out that the f be i as our chief investigative agency
is properly manned and equipped to carry on extensive information gathering functions within the united states
it was also suggested that it would take a substantial period of time for the secret service to build up the experience and skills necessary to meet the problem
consequently the suggestion has been made on the one hand that all preventive investigative functions relating to the security of the president
should be transferred to the f bei
leaving with the secret service only the responsibility for the physical protection of the president that is the guarding function alone
on the other hand it is urged that all features of the protection of the president and his family should be committed to an elete and independent corps
it is also contended that the agents should be intimately associated with the life of the presidential family
in all its ramifications and alert to every danger that might befall it
and ready at any instant to hazard great danger to themselves in the performance of their tremendous responsibility
it is suggested that an organization shorn of its power to investigate all the possibilities of danger to the president
and becoming merely the recipient of information gathered by others would become limited solely to acts of physical alertness and personal courage
incident to its responsibilities
so circumscribed it could not maintain the esprit de corps or the necessary alertness for this unique and challenging responsibility
while in accordance with its mandate
this commission has necessarily examined into the functioning of the various federal agencies concerned with a tragic trip of president kennedy to dalis
and while it has arrived at certain conclusions in respect there too it seems clear
that it was not within the commission's responsibility to make specific recommendations as to the long range organization of the president's protection
except as conclusions flowing directly from its examination of the president's assassination can be drawn
the commission was not asked to apply itself as did the hoover commission in nineteen forty nine
for examples to a determination of the optimum organization of the president's protection
it would have been necessary for the commission to take considerable testimony much of it extraneous to the facts of the assassination of president kennedy
to put it in a position to reach final conclusions in this respect
there are always dangers of divided responsibility
duplication and confusion of authority where more than one agency is operating in the same field but on the other hand
the protection of the president is in a real sense a government wide responsibility which must necessarily be assumed by the department of state
the f b i the s y a and the military intelligence agencies as well as the secret service
moreover a number of imponderable questions have to be weighed if any change in the intimate association now established
between the secret service and the president and his family is contemplated
these considerations have induced the commission to believe
that the determination of whether or not there should be a relocation of responsibilities and functions should be left to the executive and the congress
perhaps upon recommendations based on further studies by the cabinet level committee recommended above or the national security council
pending any such determination however this commission is convinced of the necessity of better co ordination
and direction of the activities of all existing agencies of government which are in a position to and do furnish information
and services related to the security of the president
the commission feels the secret service and the f be i as well as the state department and the c  a when the president travels abroad
could improve their existing capacities and procedures so as to lessen the chances of assassination
without therefore coming to final conclusions respecting the long range organization of the president's security
the commission believes that the facts of the assassination of president kennedy point to certain measures which
while assuming no radical relocation of responsibilities
can and should be recommended by this commission in the interest of the more efficient protection of the president

by the president's commission on the assassination of president kennedy chapter eight the protection of the president part five
general supervision of the secret service
the intimacy of the secret services relationship to the white house
and the dissimilarity of its protective functions to most activities of the department of the treasury
have made it difficult for the treasury to maintain close and continuing supervision
the commission believes that the recommended cabinet level committee will help to correct many of the major deficiencies of supervision
disclosed by the commission's investigation
other measures should be taken as well to improve the overall operation of the secret service
daily supervision of the operations of the secret service within the department of the treasury should be improved
the chief of the service now reports to the secretary of the treasury
through an assistant secretary whose duties also include
the direct supervision of the bureau of the mint
and the department's employment policy programme and who also representsthe secretary of the treasury on various committees in groups
the incumbent has no technical qualifications in the area of presidential protection
the commission recommends that the secretary of the treasury appoint a special assistant with the responsibility of supervising the service
this special assistant should be required to have sufficient stature and experience in law enforcement intelligence or allied fields
to be able to provide effective continuing supervision
and to keep the secretary fully informed regarding all significant developments relating to presidential protection
this report has already pointed out several respects
in which the commission believes that the secret service has operated with insufficient planning or control
actions by the service since the assassination indicate its awareness of the necessity for substantial improvement in its administration
a formal and thorough description of the responsibilities of the advance agent is now in preparation by the service
work is going forward
toward the preparation of formal understandings of the respective roles of the secret service and other agencies with which it collaborates
or from which it derives assistance and support
the commission urges that the service continue this effort to overhaul and define its procedures
while manuals and memoranda are no guarantee of effective operations
no sizable organization can achieve efficiency without the careful analysis and demarcation of responsibility
that is reflected indefinite and comprehensive operating procedures
the commission also recommends
that the secret service consciously set about the task of inculcating and maintaining the highest standard of excellence and es pree for all of its personnel
this involves tight and unswerving discipline as well as the promotion of an outstanding degree of dedication and loyalty to duty
the commission emphasizes that it finds no causal connection between the assassination
and the breach of regulations which occurred on the night of november twenty one at fort worth
nevertheless such a breach in which so many agents participated
is not consistent with the standards which the responsibilities of the secret service require it to meet
preventive intelligence
in attempting to identify those individuals who might prove a danger to the president
the secret service has largely been the passive recipient of threatening communications to the president
and reports from other agencies which independently evaluate their information for potential sources of danger
this was the consequence of the services lack of an adequate investigatede staff
its inability to process large amounts of data and its failure to provide specific descriptions of the kind of information it sought
the secret service has embarked upon a complete overhaul of its research activities
the staff of the protective research section p r s
has been augmented and a secret service inspector has been put in charge of this operation with the assistance of the president's office of science and technology
and of the advanced research projects agency of the department of defence
it has obtained the services of outside consultants such as the rand corporation
international business machines corporation and a panel of psychiatric and psychological experts
it has received assistance also from doubt a processing experts at the s a a
and from a specialist in psychiatric prognostication at walter reed hospital
as a result of these studies the planning document submitted by the secretary of the treasury to the bureau of the budget on august thirty one
nineteen sixty four makes several significant recommendations in this field
based on the commission's investigation the following minimum gols for improvements are indicated
broader and more selective criteria
since the assassination
both the secret service and the f be i have recognized
that the piere spiles can no longer be limited largely to persons communicating actual threats to the president
on december twenty sixth nineteen sixty three the f be ie circulated additional instructions to all its agents
specifying criteria for information to be furnished to the secret service in addition to that covered by the former standard
which was the possibility of an attempt against the person or safety of the president
the new instructions require f ba agents to report immediately information concerning quote
subversives ultra ritists racests and fashists a possessing emotional instability or irrational behavior
b who have made threats of bodily harm against officials or employees of federal state or local government or officials of a foreign government
see who express or have expressed strong or violent antiuus sentiments
and who have been involved in bombing or bomb making or whose past conduct indicates tendencies towards violence and d
whose prior acts or statements depict propensity for violence and hatred against organized government and quoth
allen h belmont assistant to the director of the f b i
testified that this revision was initiated by the f be ee itself
the volume of references to the secret service has increased substantially since the new instructions went into effect
more than five thousand names were referred to the secret service in the first four months of nineteen sixty four
according to chief raly by mid june nineteen sixty four
the secret service had received from the f be i some nine thousand reports on members of the communist party
the f be i now transmits information on all defectors a category which would of course have included oswald
both director hover and belmont expressed to the commission the great concern of the f be i which is shared by the secret service
that were furls to the sacred service under the new criteria might if not properly handled
result in some degree of interference with the personal liberty of those involved
they emphasized the necessity that the information now being furnished be handled with judgment and care
the commission shares this concern
the problem is aggravated by the necessity
that the service obtained the assistance of local law enforcement officials in evaluating the information which it receives
and in taking preventive steps
in june nineteen sixty four the secret service sent to a number of federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies
guide lines for an experimental programme to develop more detailed criteria
the suggestions of federal agencies for revision of these guide lines were solicited
the new tentative criteria are useful in making clear that
the interest of the secret service goes beyond information on individuals or groups threatening to cause harm or embarrassment to the president
information is requested also concerning individuals or groups who have demonstrated an interest in the president
or quote other high government officials in the nature of a complaint coupled with an expressed or implied determination to use a means
other than legal or peaceful to satisfy any grievance real or imagined
under these criteria whether the case should be referred to the secret service depends on the existence of a previous history of mental instability
propensity toward violent action or some similar characteristic coupled with some evaluation of the capability of the individual or group
to further the intention to satisfy a grievance by unlawful means
while these tentative criteria are a step in the right direction
they seem unduly restrictive in continuing to require some manifestation of animus against a government official
it is questionable whether such criteria would have resulted in the refurl of oswald to the secret service
chief ralligh believed that they would
because of oswald's demonstrated hostility toward the secretary of the navy in his letter of january thirtieth nineteen sixty two quote
i shall employ all means to write this gross mistake or injustice to a bonafied u s citizen an ex service man
the u s government has no charges or complaints against me
i ask you to look into this case and take the necessary steps to repair the damage done to me and my family andqute
even with the advantage of hind sight this letter does not appear to express or imply oswald's quote
determination to use a means other than legal or peaceful to satisfy his grievance and quote within the meaning of the new criterio
it is apparent that a good deal of further consideration and experimentation will be required
before adequate criteria can be framed
the commission recognizes that no set of meaningful criterio will yield the names of all potential assassins charles j guito
leon f chalcos
john shrank and guiseppe zangara four assassins or would be assassins
were all men who acted alone in their criminal acts against our leaders none had a serious record of prior violence
each of them was a failure in his work and in his relations with others a victim of delusions and fancies which led to the conviction
that society and its leaders had combined to thwart him it will require every available resource of our government
to devise a practical system which has any reasonable possibility of revealing such malecontents
liaizon with other agencies regarding intelligence
the secret services liaison with the agencies that supply information to it has been too casual
since the assassination the service has recognized that these relationships must be far more formal
and each agency given clear understanding of the assistance which the secret service expects
once the secret service has formulated its new standards for collection of information it should enter into written agreements with each federal agency
and the leading state and local agencies that might be a source of such information
such agreements should describe in detail the information which is sought the manner in which it will be provided to the secret service
and the respective responsibilities for any further investigation that may be required
this is especially necessary with regard to the f be i and se ay a
which carry the major responsibility for supplying information about potential threats
particularly those arising from organized groups within their special jurisdiction
since these agencies are already obliged constantly to evaluate the activities of such groups
they should be responsible for advising the secret service if information develops indicating the existence of an assassination plot
and for reporting such events as a change in leadership or dogma which indicate that the group may present a danger to the president
detailed formal agreements embodying these arrangements should be worked out between the secret service and both of these agencies
it should be made clear that the secret service will in no way seek to duplicate the intelligence
and investigative capabilities of the agencies now operating in this field but will continue
to use the data developed by these agencies to carry out its special duties
once experience has been gained in implementing such agreements with the federal and leading state and local agencies
the secret service through its field offices
should negotiate similar arrangements with such other state and local law enforcement agencies as may provide meaningful assistance
much useful information will come to the attention of local law enforcement agencies in the regular course of their activities
and this source should not be neglected by undue concentration on relationships with other federal agencies
finally these agreements with federal and local authorities will be of little value
unless a system is established for the frequent formal review of activities they'are under
in this regard
the commission notes with approval
several recent measures taken and proposed by the secret service to improve its liaison arrangements
in his testimony secretary of the treasury c douglas dillon informed the commission
that an inter agency committee has been established to develop more effective criteria
according to secretary dillon
the committee will include representatives of the president's office of science and technology department of defence
see ay a
f be i and the secret service
in addition
the department of the treasury has requested five additional agents for its protective research section
to serve as liaison officers with law enforcement and intelligence agencies on the basis of the department's review during the past several months
secretary dillon testified that the use of such liis on officers is the only effective way to insure that adequately aison is maintained
has a beginning step to improve liaison with local law enforcement officials the secret service on august twenty sixth nineteen sixty four
directed its field representatives to send a form request for intelligence information to all local
county and state law enforcement agencies in their districts
each of these efforts appear sound
and the commission recommends that these and the other measures suggested by the commission be pursued vigorously by secret service
automatic data processing
unless the secret service is able to deal rapidly and accurately with a growing body of data
the increased information supplied by other agencies will be wasted
p r s must develop the capacity to classify its subjects on a more sophisticated basis than the present geographic breakdown
its present manual filing system is obsolete
it makes no use of the recent developments an automatic date a prosessing which are widely used in the business world and in other government offices
the secret service in the department of the treasury now recognized this critical need
in the planning document currently under review by the bureau of the budget the department recommends that it be permitted to hire five qualified persons quote
to plan and develop a workable and efficient automated file and retrieval system and growth
also the department requests the sum of one hundred thousand dollars to conduct a detailed feasibility study
this money would be used to compensate consultans to lease standard equipment
or to purchase specially designed pilot equipment
on the basis of such a feasibility study
the department hopes to design a practical system which will fully meet the needs of the protective research section of the secret service
the commission recommends that prompt and favorable consideration be given to this request
the commission further recommends that the secret service co ordinate its planning as closely as possible with all the federal agencies from which it receives information
the secret service should not and does not plan to develop its own intelligence gathering facilities to duplicate the existing facilities of other federal agencies
implanting its data processing technique
the secret service should attempt to develop a system compatible with those of the agencies from which most of its data will come
note
in a valuating date of processing technique of the secret service
the commission had occasion to become informed to a limited extent about the date of processing techniques of other federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies
the commission was struck by the apparent lack of effort on an inter agency basis
to develop co ordinated and mutually compatible systems even where such co ordination would not seem inconsistent
with the particular purposes of the agency involved the commission recognizes that this is a controversial area
and that many strongly held views are advanced in resistance to any suggestion that an effort be made to impose any degree of co ordination
this matter is obviously beyond the jurisdiction of the commission
but it seems to warrant further study before each agency becomes irrevocably committed to separate action
the commission therefore recommends that the president consider ordering an inquiry into the possibility
that co ordination might be achieved to a greater extent than seems now to be contemplated without interference with the primary mission of each agency involved
protective research participation in advance arrangements
since the assassination secret service procedures have been changed to require that a member of piaras accompany each advance surveyhteenm
to establish liaison with local intelligence gathering agencies and to provide for the immediate evaluation of information received from them
this piress agent will also be responsible for establishing an informal localliais on committee
to make certain that all protective intelligence activities are co ordinated
based on its experience during this period the secret service now recommends that additional personnel be made available to piares
so that these arrangements can be made permanent without adversely affecting the operations of the services field offices
the commission regards this as a most useful innovation and urges that the practice be continued
liaison with local law enforcement agencies
adviced by the secret service to local police and metropolitan areas relating to the assistance expected in connection with a presidential visit
has hitherto been handled on an informal basis
the service should consider preparing formal explanations of the co operation anticipated during a presidential visit to a city
in four macs that can be communicated to each level of local authorities
thus the local chief of police could be given a master plan
prepared for the occasion
of all protective measures to be taken during the visit
each patrol men might be given a prepared booklet of instructions explaining what is expected of him the secret service has expressed concern
that written instructions might come into the hands of local newspapers to the prejudice of the precautions described
however the instructions must be communicated to the local police in any event and can be leaked to the press whether or not they are in writing
more importantly the lack of carefully prepared and carefully transmitted instructions for typical visits to cities
ken lead to lapse is in protection such as the confusion and douwless about whether members of the public were permitted on over passes
such instructions will not fit all circumstances of course
and should not be relied upon to the detriment of the imaginative application of judgment in special cases
inspection of buildings
since the assassination of president kennedy the secret service has been experimenting with new technique in the inspection of buildings along a motor cade rout
according to secretary dillon
the studies indicate that there is some utility in attempting to designate certain buildings as involving a higher risk than others
the commission strongly encourages these efforts to improve protection along a motor cayde rout
the secret service should utilize the personnel of other federal law enforcement offices
in the locality to assure adequate man power for this task as it is now doing
lack of adequate resources is an unacceptable excuse for failing to improve advance precautions
in this crucial area of presidential protection
secret service personnel and facilities
testimony and other evidence before the commission
suggests that secret service is trying to accomplish its job with too few people and without adequate modern equipment
although chief rally does not complain about the pay scale for secret service agents
salaries are below those of the f b i and leading municipal police forces
the assistant to the director of the f ti a testified that
the case load of each ft bei agent average twenty to twenty five and he felt that this was high
chief rally testified that the present work load of each secret service agent averages one hundred ten point one cases
while these statistics relate to the activities of secret service agents stationed in field offices and not the white house detail
field agents supplement those on the detail particularly when the president is travelling
although the commission does not know whether the cases involved are entirely comparable
these figures suggest that the agents of the secret service are substantially overworked
in its budget request for the fiscal year beginning july one nineteen sixty four
the secret service sought funds for twenty five new positions primarily in field offices this increase has been approved by the congress
chief rawli explained that this would not provide enough additional man power to take all the measures which he considers required
however the nineteen sixty four to sixty five budget request was submitted in november nineteen sixty three
and requests for additional personnel were not made because of the studies then being conducted
the secret service has now presented its recommendations to the bureau of the budget the plan proposed by the service
would take approximately twenty months to implement and require expenditures of approximately three million dollars during that period
the plan provides for an additional two hundred five agents for the secret service
seventeen of this number are proposed for the protective research section
one hundred forty five are proposed for the field offices to handle the increased volume of security investigations
and be available to protect the president or vice president when they travel
eighteen agents are proposed for a rotating pool
which will go through an intensive training cycle and also be available to supplement the white house detail
in case of unexpected need and twenty five additional agents are recommended to provide the vice president full protection
the commission urges that the bureau of the budget review these recommendations with the secret service and authorize a request for the necessary supplemental appropation
as soon as it can be justified
the congress has often stressed that it will support any reasonable request for funds for the protection of the president
man power and technical assistance from other agencies
before the assassination the secret service infrequently requested other federal law enforcement agencies to provide personnel
to assist in its protection functions
since the assassination the service has experimented with the use of agents borrowed for short periods from such agencies
it has used other treasuryn law enforcement agents on special experiments in building and route surveys in places to which the president frequently travels
it has also used other federal law enforcement agents during presidential visits to cities in which such agents are stationed
thus in the four months following the assassination
the f b i on sixteen separate occasions supplied a total of one hundred thirty nine agents to assist in protection work during a presidential visit
which represents a departure from its prior practice
from february eleven
through june thirtieth nineteen sixty four
the service had the advantage of nine thousand five hundred hours of work by other enforcement agencies
the f beyind has indicated that it is willing to continue to make such assistance available
even though it agrees with the secret service that it is preferable for the service to have enough agents to handle all protective demands
the commission indorses these efforts to supplement the service's own personnel by obtaining for short periods of time
the assistance of trained federal law enforcement officers
in view of the ever increasing mobility of american presidents it seems unlikely that the service could or should increase its own staff to a size
which would permit it to provide adequate protective man power for all situations
the commission recommends that the agencies involved determine how much periodic assistance they can provide and that each such agency
and the secret service enter into a formal agreement defining such arrangements
it may eventually be desirable to codify the practice in an executive order
the secret service will be better able to plan its own long range personal requirements if it knows with reasonable certainty
the amount of assistance that it can expect from other agencies
the occasional use of personal from other federal agencies to assist in protecting the president has a further advantage it symbolizes the reality
that the job of protecting the president has not been and cannot be exclusively the responsibility of the secret service
the secret service in the past has sometimes guarded its right to be acknowledged as the sole protector of the chief executive
this no longer appears to be the case
protecting the president is a difficult and complex task
which requires full use of the best resources of many parts of our government
recognition that the responsibility must be shared increases the likelihood that it will be met
much of the secret service work requires the development and use of highly sophisticated equipment
some of which must be specially designed to fit unique requirements even before the assassination and to a far greater extent thereafter
the secret service has been receiving full co operation in scientific research and technological development
from many government agencies including the department of defence and the president's office of science and technology
even if the man power and technological resources of the secret service are adequately augmented
it will continue to rely in many respects upon the greater resources of the office of science and technology and other agencies
the commission recommends that the present arrangements
with the office of science and technology and the other federal agencies that have been so helpful to the secret service be placed on a permanent and formal basis
the exchange of letters dated august thirty one nineteen sixty four
between secretary dillon and donald f hornick special assistant to the president for science and technology is a useful effort in the right direction
e service should negotiate a memorandum of understanding with each agency that has been assisting it and from which it can expect to need help in the future
the essential terms of such memoranda might well be embodied in an executive order
this commission can recommend no procedures for the future protection of our presidents which will guarantee security
the demands on the president  the execution of his responsibilities into day's world are so varied and complex
and the traditions of the office in a democracy such as ours are so deep seated as to preclude absolute security
the commission has however from its examination of the facts of president kennedy's assassination
made certain recommendations which it believes would if adopted
materially improve upon the procedure's ineffect at the time of president kennedy's assassination and result in a substantial lessening of the danger
as has been pointed out the commission has not resolved all the proposals which could be made
the commission nevertheless is confident that
with the active co operation of the responsible agencies and with the understanding of the people of the united states and their demands upon their president
the recommendations we have here suggested
would greatly advance the security of the office
without any impairment of our fundamental liberties
